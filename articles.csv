According to CNBC, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives believes that the ""AI M&A floodgates"" are set to open wide as Big Tech and private equity firms compete to buy their way to dominance. Ives predicts that a friendlier regulatory climate under the new administration will pave the way for a surge in dealmaking in the tech sector. Ives spotlights several smaller, specialized firms being absorbed by deep-pocketed giants seeking to bridge capability gaps. Among them, Ives highlights C3.ai (AI), Sandisk (SNDK), and Tenable Holdings (TENB) as particularly appealing. Valued at $18.6 billion, Sandisk is a technology company best known for creating, manufacturing, and distributing flash memory storage systems. These are utilized in various applications, including smartphones, cameras, computers, and data centers. Sandisk's relisting under the SNDK ticker earlier this year has been one of the most incredible comeback stories in tech. Since February, the stock has risen by more than 288%, driven by increased demand for high-performance data storage solutions required for AI workloads. AI models demand massive storage and memory capacities, and Sandisk's next-generation flash technology may make it an appealing target for Big Tech firms developing or expanding AI data centers. For the full fiscal year 2025, Sandisk reported a 10% increase in revenue to $7.3 billion. The company also reported a profit of $2.99 per share compared to a loss of $3.46 per share in fiscal 2024. Analysts expect Sandisk’s revenue to climb by 22% to $8.9 billion, with earnings increasing by 119% to $6.55 per share, respectively. The competitive landscape, however, remains fierce, with Micron (MU) dominating this space in both the NAND and DRAM markets. Flash memory manufacturing is capital-intensive and highly sensitive to pricing swings. Even little fluctuations in demand or supply can have a long-term impact on profitability. Overall, Wall Street rates Sandisk stock a consensus “Moderate Buy.” Out of the 18 analysts who cover SNDK, 11 recommend a “Strong Buy,” six recommend a “Hold,” and one suggests a “Strong Sell.” The stock has surpassed its average analyst price target of $94.28. However, the high price estimate of $150 implies an upside potential of 8% over the next 12 months. Stock #2: C3.ai (AI) C3.ai has long been a prominent name in enterprise AI. According to Ives, it could be one of the most sought-after targets in this upcoming AI M&A wave. The company offers software that enables enterprises to use AI at scale, including predictive analytics, automation, and data-driven insights in industries such as defense, energy, and manufacturing. The stock has fallen 45% year-to-date (YTD), as the company faces significant operational issues despite its early-mover advantage. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, revenue declined 19% year-over-year (YoY) to $70.3 million, signaling a troubling slowdown just as AI adoption accelerates globally. The primary concern, however, remains profitability. C3.ai reported a net loss of $49.8 million, or $0.37 per share, with negative free cash flow of $34.3 million. Despite having more than $711 million in cash reserves, the company continues to lose capital each quarter, raising concerns about how long it can continue operations without significant improvements in efficiency or revenue momentum. Management cited poor sales execution and internal discord as the key causes of the decline and stated that the company is restructuring to address its situation. Analysts predict that the company will continue to lose money for the next two years, despite its expanding portfolio of more than 131 enterprise AI applications. Ives believes C3.ai would be an attractive acquisition target for firms such as Apple (AAPL), IBM (IBM), and Oracle (ORCL), all of which are looking to expand their AI infrastructure and enterprise integration capabilities. C3.ai’s struggles have not gone unnoticed on Wall Street. Overall, AI stock is rated as a “Hold.” Out of the 15 analysts who cover the stock, three rate it a “Strong Buy,” six rate it a “Hold,” two say it is a “Moderate Sell,” and four say it is a “Strong Sell.” The stock has surpassed the mean target price of $16.67. The Street-high estimate of $40 implies upside of 110% over the next 12 months. Stock #3: Tenable Holdings (TENB) With cybersecurity becoming inseparable from AI, Tenable Holdings represents another logical acquisition opportunity. The company specializes in exposure management and vulnerability assessment, which entails assisting organizations in identifying, measuring, and mitigating security threats before they are exploited. Although Tenable's stock is down 25% YTD, its strong client base and recurring revenue model make it a reliable long-term asset. In the second quarter, Tenable reported revenue of $247.3 million, up 12% YoY, and non-GAAP operating income of $47.7 million, reflecting a 19% operating margin. Management emphasized that the company’s growth was driven by the increasing adoption of its Tenable One platform, which offers companies a unified view of their attack surface and enables them to manage security threats more proactively. During the quarter, free cash flow totaled $44.3 million. Tenable also increased its existing stock repurchase program by $250 million, signaling confidence in its long-term growth prospects. The company has also been expanding its customer base, gaining 367 new enterprise platform customers and 76 net new six-figure accounts during the quarter. Larger cybersecurity and cloud infrastructure providers may see Tenable as a way to broaden their AI-powered threat detection capabilities. Overall, Wall Street rates TENB stock a consensus “Moderate Buy.” Out of the 24 analysts who cover TENB, 12 recommend a “Strong Buy,” one recommends a “Moderate Buy,” and 11 rate it a “Hold.” The average analyst price target of $39.84 represents a potential 35% increase from current levels. Furthermore, the high price estimate of $45 implies an upside potential of 52% over the next 12 months.

September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) are up +0.43%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) are up +0.54%. Stock indexes are moving higher today, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 posting new all-time highs. Falling bond yields are supportive for stocks ahead of the Tue/Wed FOMC meeting, when the Fed is expected to cut interest rates by 25 bp. The 10-year T-note yield is down -2 bp to 4.04%. Also, Tesla is up more than +5% to lead megacap technology stocks higher after Elon Musk bought nearly $1 billion in stock. Gains in stocks are limited due to some weakness in chipmakers, with Nvidia down more than -1% after China ruled that the company violated anti-monopoly laws after acquiring Mellanox Technologies in 2020. Also, Texas Instruments is down more than -2% after China said it was launching an anti-dumping investigation targeting a type of semiconductor made by the company. Today's US economic news was bearish for stocks after the Sep Empire manufacturing survey general business conditions fell -20.6 to a three-month low of -8.7, weaker than expectations of 5.0. Most major US benchmark indexes, including the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrials, and the Nasdaq 100, posted record highs last week, driven by expectations of Fed interest rate cuts. Weak labor market news and relatively contained inflation reports bolstered expectations for at least a 25 bp rate cut by the Fed at the Tue/Wed FOMC meeting and a total of 75 bp of rate cuts by year's end. Weakness in Chinese economic news is negative for global growth prospects. China's Aug industrial production rose +5.2% y/y, weaker than expectations of +5.6% y/y. Also, China's Aug retail sales rose +3.4% y/y, weaker than expectations of +3.8% y/y. In addition, the China Aug surveyed jobless rate unexpectedly rose +0.1 to a 6-month high of 5.3%, showing a weaker labor market than expectations of no change at 5.2%.

The markets are pricing in a 100% chance of a -25 bp rate cut and a 5% chance of a -50 bp rate cut at the conclusion of the Tue/Wed FOMC meeting. After the fully expected -25 bp rate cut at Wednesday's meeting, the markets are discounting an 86% chance of a second -25 bp rate cut at the Oct 28-29 meeting. The markets are pricing in an overall -70 bp rate cut in the federal funds rate by year-end to 3.63% from the current 4.33% rate. Overseas stock markets today are mixed.

Dec T-notes recovered from a 1-week low today and turned higher after the US Sep Empire manufacturing survey general business conditions fell -20.6 to a three-month low, a dovish factor for Fed policy. T-notes are also supported by expectations that the Fed will cut interest rates by at least 25 bp at the conclusion of the Tue/Wed FOMC meeting. Strength in stocks today is limiting gains in T-note prices. Concerns about Fed independence are negatively impacting T-note prices due to President Trump's attempt to fire Fed Governor Cook and Stephen Miran's intention to hold a Fed Governor position while remaining technically in his White House role on the Council of Economic Advisors. European government bond yields today are moving lower. The 10-year German bund yield is down -1.9 bp to 2.696%. The 10-year UK gilt yield is down -3.9 bp to 4.632%. The German Aug wholesale price index fell -0.6% m/m, the biggest decline in a year.

fa9514c33e400b2bfad3fc8e9731aceaa84b4c88ba2f3de327d36c42eb0a7997,AAPL,Alibaba Has AI Written All Over It : Here Why Buying BABA Stock Makes Sense,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-ai-written-over-why-203907438.html,finance.yahoo.com,20250913T023000Z,semi,0.65,"With a year-to-date (YTD) gain of nearly 70%, Alibaba's (BABA) stock has outperformed the markets significantly this year. The Chinese tech giant, which was once the face of China’s brutal tech crackdown, is now back in the government’s good graces as the country backs its domestic companies amid the artificial intelligence (AI) upmanship between the U.S. and China. Alibaba is among the prominent AI plays in China and has attracted interest from investors seeking to capitalize on the China AI story. In my previous article, I had noted that it made sense to buy the dip in BABA stock. The stock has since rebounded and only gained traction following the release of the June quarter earnings. In this article, we’ll look at the forecast for BABA stock, but before that, let’s briefly analyze its fiscal Q1 2026 earnings. Alibaba posted a mixed set of numbers for the fiscal first quarter. The company’s revenues rose merely 2% to $34.57 billion, and while the growth after accounting for disposed businesses was a healthy 10%, the metric nonetheless fell short of estimates. Alibaba’s operating income also fell 3% to $4.88 billion. Its net income rose 76% year-over-year to $6.01 billion, coming in ahead of Street estimates. However, the sharp rise was predominantly driven by gains on asset disposals and mark-to-market changes in equity investments. The company’s instant commerce business continues to grow at a fast pace, and last month, the monthly active users approached 300 million. It was at best a moderate performance from Alibaba in Q1, but the stock soared following the confessional amid optimism over the company’s cloud and AI business. Alibaba’s Earnings Had AI Written All Over It Alibaba’s earnings had AI written all over them, and the “magic word” featured prominently in both the prepared release and earnings call. The strategic direction management is trying to steer Alibaba was obvious when the management talked about AI first and mentioned other core businesses later. Cloud Intelligence Group, which houses the company’s cloud and AI businesses, saw a 26% rise in revenues in the June quarter. Alibaba said that AI-related revenue accounted for a fifth of revenues from external customers in its Cloud business, while emphasizing that the business has grown in triple digits for eight consecutive quarters. The company is also reportedly working on its own AI chip, which would not only help it reduce reliance on Nvidia (NVDA) but also potentially open up revenue opportunities from third-party customers. What Makes Alibaba a Prominent AI Play Alibaba is a prominent AI player in China and has partnered with several companies, including BMW (BMWKY) and SAP (SAP). It is also collaborating with Apple (AAPL) to bring “Apple Intelligence” features to iPhones in China. Given China’s strict data policies, any foreign company looking to offer AI services in China might need to partner with domestic Chinese companies, which is an opportunity for Chinese AI giants like Alibaba. BABA Stock Forecast Brokerages turned incrementally bullish on Alibaba, and several raised BABA's target price following the fiscal Q1 earnings. Among others, Benchmark, Bank of America, Baird, J.P. Morgan, Barclays, and Mizuho bumped up BABA's target price, with Benchmark raising its target to a Street-high of $195. Arete Research upgraded BABA stock from a “neutral” to “buy” while raising its target price to $152. Overall, BABA is rated a “Strong Buy” by the 22 analysts polled by Barchart, while the stock’s mean target price is $167.84, about 16% higher than the Sept. 10 closing prices. Should You Buy BABA Stock? I have been bullish on BABA stock for quite some time now and have used drawdowns of the kind we saw earlier this year to add to my positions. I remain bullish on Alibaba, and while the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 19.1x might seem a bit high for comfort, the multiple looks elevated given the short-term earnings impact from the losses in its instant e-commerce business. Life has come full circle for Chinese tech companies, particularly Alibaba, and far from cracking down, the Chinese government is now backing its tech companies amid the apparent AI war with the U.S. The changed stance bodes well for valuations of Chinese companies, which had become “uninvestible” for many funds following the 2021 tech crackdown. Both AI and instant commerce, which Alibaba has termed “2 huge historic opportunities,” would drive the company’s growth over the long term, and I feel comfortable holding my shares at the current price levels even as arguably the stock’s margin of safety in the short term is not as enticing as it was a couple of months back.

fa39d10eeac090185ff47ea561d2ba4e71f2c693a8b2e7490ea00804f78b6394,AAPL,"Why My System Didnt Pick Tesla … but Dug Up 1 , 115 % Gains in Amazon",https://investorplace.com/smartmoney/2025/09/system-didnt-pick-tesla-1115-gains-amazon/,investorplace.com,20250908T160000Z,semi,0.65,"Hello, Reader. In 1984, one of Gary Larson’s Far Side cartoons pictured two cavemen. One hoisted up the feet of the other, who was lying face-down in the dirt. The caption read… “Barrow”—precursor to the game of “wheelbarrow.” The gag is that predating the invention of wheel, humans had to “play” wheelbarrow without the rolling tool. Now well-equipped with the revolutionary device, we can laugh at these poor cartoon cavemen, our faces squeaky clean and our lives streamlined by tools. Tools, like the wheel, have long given us humans unique advantages for success. They work as physical extensions of the human body. And now, thanks to technological advancements like AI, tools can work as an extension of the human mind, too. And I’ve been working on a project over the last five years to add the “wheel” to my investing “barrow,” so to speak. Let me explain… My strategy has always been big picture. The technical term is “global macro investing.” I’ve always started the process by looking at worldwide financial phenomena. That’s the global. Next, I’m looking for major macroeconomic trends that create unique investment opportunities. That’s the macro. Only then do I drill down to find the stocks poised to ride those trends. Generally, you can find opportunities buried inside any major global trend. AI, for example, can push a stock higher for years. So, you can think of my global macro investing approach as the foundational “barrow.” But now, thanks to advancements in computing technology, I have added the “wheel” part to the equation. My new system – Apogee – has discovered all the factors behind my 41 1,000%-plus gainers and turned that into a computerized “wheel.” It finds stocks when they are furthest away their true potential, and gives a buy signal as they are moving toward that potential. It makes for a less humorous comic, but an even more successful investment strategy. Today, I’d like to share why it selectively identifies certain winners – like Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) – while bypassing other big names… like Tesla Inc. (TSLA). Let’s dive in… Racking Up the Gains First, I’d like to share how my macro-investing approach works in action. In February 2023, when AI was the newest megatrend to burst onto the scene, I recommended Amazon to my Fry’s Investment Report subscribers. I said in my initial recommendation… To be honest, I never imagined recommending such a high-profile stock. But I’m making a rare exception because I believe the AI investment opportunity is exceptionally large and that these companies will be among the earliest major beneficiaries… For many of us, these giant companies and their trillion-dollar valuations seem like grand monuments to past achievements – not cutting-edge investment opportunities. AI is demolishing that narrative. It is creating an entirely new foundation for explosive growth at companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet. These big tech names are perfectly positioned to capitalize on the early phases of our new AI boom. That’s because when it comes to creating and deploying AI technologies, bigger is often better… In effect, the Big Tech companies are AI. They have the money and the muscle to create valuable AI solutions and then apply those solutions to spectacular commercial effect – i.e., make boatloads of money. And I was correct. About 17 months after my initial recommendation, I sold half of the stock for a partial gain of 115%. By comparison, the S&P 500 index had gained just 41% in the same time period. A few months later, as Big Tech started the monstrously expensive investment of sowing a new crop of data centers, AI infrastructure, and services, I recommended exiting the remaining one-half position of Amazon for a 100% gain. In all, my subscribers had the opportunity to book triple-digit gains on Amazon – twice. But what’s better than a triple-digit gain? A 10X one. And that’s exactly what my Apogee system detected… To train my system, I ran 5.2 million backtests, dating back 30 years, on approximately 14,000 stocks. And in those backtests, Apogee flagged Amazon. This is because my system uses a host of proprietary indicators to unearth 10X opportunities. To put it simply, I call these indicators my 10X Pattern. Here’s a short summary of how it works… - First, the company is “down a lot.” That means the stock needs to have fallen from its highs by at least 40%. - Then, a period of stabilization that eventually produces an “up a little” move… - And that triggers my system’s rare buy signal. This is when the big moves can arrive. And Amazon checked all of the boxes. First, it had crashed nearly 90% after the early-2000s “dot com” bust. Factor #1, check. But its revenues had also shot up 26% over the prior 12-month period, putting its revenue growth in a “sweet spot.” Factor #2, check. My system then ran Amazon through the rest of its proprietary indicators. It confirmed that Amazon had entered the 10X pattern and triggered a buy signal. Factor #3, check. Here’s what happened next… A 1,115% gain. Now, my triple-digit gains on Amazon were sizable, but Apogee’s pick delivered about 1,000% more than that. And it didn’t just flag Amazon. It generated 1,871% on Nvidia Corp. (NVDA)… 1,551% on Cadence Design Systems Inc. (CDNS)… and 4,285% on Apple Inc. (AAPL) during extensive back-tests. However, Apogee is not designed to pick up every single company that does well. Instead, it’s designed to pick up a company at its most optimal point. Here’s what that means… Why Apogee Avoided Tesla It identifies stocks with massive potential and relatively small downside risk. That is why it recommended Amazon only after the stock had tanked, and then passed my 10X pattern. That means that some big winners – like Tesla for example – don’t make the cut. Among my other 10X factors, it has not fallen 40% from its all-time high. So, my system did not flag Tesla. Although the EV maker has fallen more than 40%, the company was never quite strong enough to warrant a significant investment. In fact, Tesla was fairly close to bankruptcy several times – a risk I find unacceptable in my recommendations to subscribers. In December 2008, Tesla only made payroll after Daimler injected $50 million into the ailing firm. In 2013, it was operating with “maybe one to two weeks of money.” And in 2017, the mismanaged ramp-up of the Model 3 meant the company was burning through $7,430 per minute. This discernment is a key feature of Apogee, not a bug. Companies like Tesla are exceedingly rare, and I’m not interested in making longshot bets that don’t pan out 99% of the time. And it also why the next pick that comes out of this system could be the next Amazon… the next Nvidia… or the next Apple. I’m unveiling this system for the first time ever at my 10X Breakthrough broadcast on September 10, at 10 a.m. ET. You can reserve your spot for that free event by going here. During that broadcast, I’ll show how I use those five 10X Factors to spot potential big long-term winners in advance. I will also reveal five of the system’s first “official” recommendations – including their names, ticker symbols, and when they flashed “Buy” in my new system – during my 10X Breakthrough event, for free. One of these picks is an obscure robotics play that could very well be on its way to becoming the next Nvidia. So, you won’t want to miss out on this event.

On Wednesday, a U.S. federal judge, Amit Mehta, allowed Google to retain its Chrome browser and preserve its vital $20 billion annual search partnership with Apple (AAPL). More News from Barchart - Supermicro Stock Drops 29% in a Month: Is SMCI a Buy, Sell, or Hold? - Tesla Now Has an India Problem. What Does That Mean for Hard-Hit TSLA Stock? Today’s rally in Google stock builds on the massive gains it has already notched over the past four months. Versus early April, the so-called “Magnificent 7” stock is now up well over 60%. Should You Buy Google Stock After the Federal Court Ruling? Alphabet shares appear particularly attractive as a long-term holding following the removal of this regulatory overhang. They are, in fact, a quintessential example of growth at a reasonable price (GARP). In its latest reported quarter, the tech behemoth saw its revenue come in up 14% on a year-on-year basis. Still, GOOGL stock is currently going for a forward price-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 21x only, representing a significant discount to both the broader tech sector as well as its mega-cap peers. This valuation discrepancy suggests potential for multiple expansion as markets reprice Alphabet in light of the improved regulatory clarity. GOOGL Shares Could Soon Reclaim Their Historical Premium Bank of America analyst Justin Post reiterated his “Buy” rating on GOOGL shares following the federal court ruling on Wednesday. In his research note, Post cited “evidence of Gemini progress and search usage growth” as potential catalysts for multiple expansion toward historical premiums. The BofA analyst raised his price target as well to $252, indicating potential upside of another 10% in Google stock from current levels. Alphabet currently pays a dividend yield of 0.37% and has a rather lucrative $70 billion stock buyback program in place, which makes GOOGL stock even more exciting to own for the longer term. Google Remains a ‘Buy’-Rated Stock Among Wall Street Analysts Google’s strong positioning across search, YouTube, and cloud computing, combined with its fast emerging AI capabilities, is keeping other Wall Street analysts bullish on its stock as well. According to Barchart, the consensus rating on GOOGL stock currently sits at “Strong Buy.”"

In the middle of this storm, Apple (AAPL) is gearing up for its biggest moment of the year. On Sept. 9, all eyes will be on Apple Park in Cupertino, where CEO Tim Cook will unveil the much-hyped iPhone 17 lineup at the company’s annual fall event. The invite teases an “awe dropping” experience, hinting at a redesigned, ultra-thin iPhone alongside refreshed Pro models, upgraded cameras, and next-gen Apple Watches. But this launch is not just about shiny new gadgets. With slowing upgrade cycles, retiring Plus models, and analysts hinting at a possible AAPL stock selloff, the event could be a defining moment. For fans, it’s about the magic, but for investors, it’s about momentum. Sept. 9 will decide which side wins. About Apple Stock California-based Apple needs no introduction. Founded in 1976, the tech titan revolutionized personal computing with the Macintosh in 1984, reshaped music with the iPod, and transformed communication with the iPhone. Boasting a $3.4 trillion market capitalization, Apple leads innovation with the iPhone, iPad, Mac, AirPods, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision Pro. Its six platforms — iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, visionOS, and tvOS — deliver seamless integration, fueling services like the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud, and Apple TV+. Known for its ecosystem, brand loyalty, and global scale, Apple remains a defining force in consumer technology and digital ecosystems, setting trends the world continues to follow. Apple might be the king of innovation, but its shares have not been spared from the market headwinds in 2025. AAPL stock is down 7% year-to-date (YTD) and trades 10% below its 52-week high of $260.10. Escalating trade tensions, looming tariffs, and regulatory headwinds have forced Apple to rethink its manufacturing footprint, while intensifying AI competition adds to investor jitters. Technically, though, AAPL stock is showing signs of strength. After bottoming near the $200 level in early August, the stock has staged a rebound over the past few weeks, breaking above its 50-day moving average and challenging the $235–$237 resistance band. A breakout here could trigger a momentum run back toward the $255-$260 zone. The 14-day RSI has bounced off oversold levels, suggesting buyers are regaining control, while volume upticks confirm institutional nibbling. Apple stock trades at a lofty 31.1 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, well above the sector — a premium that signals both power and pressure. While its ecosystem, dominance, and brand loyalty justify some of that markup, with single-digit earnings growth projected for fiscal 2026, much of the optimism is already priced in. Investors are paying up for certainty, but the upside may depend on Apple’s next big innovation play. That same confidence shows in shareholder returns. The iPhone-maker has boosted payouts for 13-straight years, with a recent $0.26 dividend in August. This takes the annual payout to $1.04, offering a modest 0.44% forward yield. Yet with a lean 13.8% payout ratio, Apple has ample firepower to keep rewarding investors. For now, its premium price reflects both trust in its empire and expectations of what’s still to come. A Snapshot of Apple’s Q3 Results On July 31, Apple released its third-quarter earnings report, and it was nothing short of a blockbuster. Revenue surged 10% year-over-year (YOY) to $94 billion. EPS climbed 12% to $1.57, surpassing Wall Street’s projections by 10.6%. Across the board, Apple smashed Street estimates, underscoring its strong fundamentals despite a shaky macro backdrop. The iPhone led the charge with a 13% YOY jump to $44.6 billion, reflecting a solid iPhone 16 lineup sale. Meanwhile, services revenue soared to an all-time high of $27.4 billion, also up by 13% annually. Mac generated $8.05 billion in revenue, and iPad brought in $6.6 billion. Apple’s gross margin came in at a healthy 46.5% at the high end of Apple’s guidance range. Plus, Apple’s growth was not confined to one region — the company reported gains across the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Asia Pacific, pushing its installed device base to new highs globally. Shareholders also reaped the rewards, with Apple returning over $27 billion to shareholders — $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $21 billion through open market repurchases of 104 million Apple shares. Despite the substantial outflows, the company concluded the quarter with a robust $36.3 billion cash reserve, underscoring its balance sheet strength and sustained liquidity position. But beyond the headlines, a different narrative brews — geopolitical pressures. CEO Tim Cook revealed Apple absorbed $800 million in tariff-related costs in Q3 and expects that to swell to $1.1 billion next quarter if trade tensions persist. While Apple is expanding manufacturing in India and Vietnam, China remains its dominant production hub, making diversification a long, capital-intensive road. The U.S. administration’s stance complicates matters further. While iPhone imports from India are exempt from the 50% tariff and proposed chip tariffs won’t hit Apple, calls for domestic manufacturing could inflate costs and risk pricing Apple’s flagship products out of reach for many U.S. consumers. Despite stellar numbers, AAPL stock closed in the red on Aug. 1, dragged down by broader market selloffs, tariff fears, and concerns about demand pull-forward ahead of potential policy shifts. Looking ahead, Apple anticipates momentum to continue into the current quarter. Management is guiding for mid-to-high single-digit annual revenue growth this quarter, with services expected to keep clocking double-digit gains. Gross margins are projected to be between 46% and 47% even after absorbing the tariff hit flagged by the CEO. Analysts monitoring the company remain optimistic, predicting EPS to be around $7.35 for fiscal 2025, up 8.9% YOY, before surging by another 6.3% annually to $7.81 in fiscal 2026. What Do Analysts Expect for Apple Stock? As the countdown to Apple’s Sept. 9 event begins, Wall Street’s outlook is split. Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan expects the event to deliver only incremental updates over the iPhone lineup, with the spotlight on a super-thin iPhone Air. The analyst maintains a “Buy” rating on AAPL with a $250 price target but warns of a potential “sell-the-news” dip, a familiar trend in which Apple stock retreats after launch before rebounding within 30 to 60 days. On the other hand, Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani sees an opportunity beyond the iPhone 17 itself. While he does not expect a major upgrade cycle from this launch, he is bullish on Apple’s AI roadmap, especially reports of a potential tie-up with Google’s (GOOGL) Gemini to revamp Siri. Daryanani rates AAPL stock as an “Outperform” with a $250 target, believing AI integration — not hardware tweaks — could reignite consumer excitement. AAPL stock has a consensus “Moderate Buy” rating overall, a vote of confidence tempered with caution. Out of 38 analysts covering the tech stock, 19 recommend a “Strong Buy,” two give a “Moderate Buy,” 15 analysts stay cautious with a “Hold” rating, and two have a “Strong Sell” rating. The average analyst price target for AAPL stock is $235.44, indicating a potential upside of 1%. The Street-high target price of $300 suggests that the stock could rally as much as 29% from here. Final Thoughts on Apple Apple has long been synonymous with cutting-edge innovation, yet in the fast-moving AI arena, its measured pace has raised eyebrows on Wall Street. Competitors are pushing boundaries, while Apple quietly taps allies to maintain its edge. As the Sept. 9 iPhone 17 unveiling nears, experts express caution over a typical post-launch pullback, given the modest upgrades. Still, past patterns hint at a rebound within weeks if Apple delivers unexpected flair — like daring AI features, strategic pricing, or a sleek, attention-grabbing iPhone Air.

Investors are choosing caution in buying NVDA at current levels mostly because of three reasons: More News from Barchart - Dear Broadcom Stock Fans, Mark Your Calendars for September 4 - CEO Alex Karp Just Sold $60 Million in Palantir Stock. Should You Ditch PLTR Here Too? - Q2 data center revenue came in a bit shy of estimates - Future guidance wasn’t strong enough for some - NVDA stock is already trading at a premium valuation However, the post-earnings pullback may be an opportunity for long-term investors to initiate or expand their positions in Nvidia stock, which is still up roughly 108% versus its year-to-date low. How High Could Nvidia Stock Fly in the Long Run? According to Ben Reitzes, a renowned tech industry expert, NVDA stock could even “double from here, if not more” over the longer term. His optimism hinges on the company’s dominant AI ecosystem and developer base, which he likened to Apple’s (AAPL) App Store advantage. “You win the developers, you win the race,” Reitzes told CNBC in an interview today, adding the company’s platform is the most monetizable for AI applications, giving it a durable competitive edge. On “Squawk Box,” the head of tech research at Melius also said Nvidia’s total addressable market (TAM) will surpass a whopping $600 billion by the end of this decade. China Overhang May Ease for NVDA Shares Ben Reitzes recommends sticking with Nvidia shares for the long term as sovereign AI initiatives in Europe and Middle East will meaningfully benefit the semiconductor giant as well. On China, he remains cautiously optimistic, believing geopolitical tensions will ease and unlock significant further upside in NVDA shares moving forward. “We’d be buyers on weakness,” the Melius expert concluded on CNBC. According to him, Nvidia will likely see even stronger momentum in its fiscal Q4 since “we’re all systems go.” How to Play Nvidia Shares After Q2 Earnings Wall Street analysts are also keeping positive on Nvidia stock after its blockbuster Q2 earnings. The consensus rating on NVDA shares remains at “Strong Buy” with price targets going as high as $250, indicating potential upside of another 40% from current levels."

Target : Which Retail Giant Is the Better Buy for 2025 ? ,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-vs-target-retail-giant-182511615.html,finance.yahoo.com,20250828T053000Z,semi,0.65,"The retail sector is entering 2025 in very different circumstances than it was just a few years ago. Tariff tensions are increasing, and consumer spending patterns are changing. In the face of these headwinds, retailers that can strike a balance between scale, value, and innovation will be best positioned to capitalize on the next phase of growth. Two household names that sit at the top of this competitive market are Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT). Both have different strategies for growth, digital transformation, and customer engagement. Let’s find out which retail stock offers the best opportunity now. The Case for Walmart Stock With a market cap of $766.6 billion, Walmart remains the largest retailer in the world by revenue. Its size remains its most significant advantage, bringing it closer to joining the exclusive $1 trillion market cap club. The retail giant operates around 10,500 stores and clubs in over 19 countries. Walmart’s stock is up 5.8% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) gain of 9.6%. In the second quarter, total revenue increased by 4.8% to $177.4 billion, while adjusted earnings per share increased by 1.5% to $0.68. The company’s e-commerce segment stood out once more, delivering 25% global growth, with Walmart and Sam’s Club outperforming expectations. Walmart increased comparable sales by 4.6% in the U.S., with strong performance in the apparel, media and gaming, and automotive categories. Sales increased by 10.5% in international markets, driven by strong performances in China, Walmex, and Flipkart. Walmart is continuing to reshape its business model by expanding into higher-margin areas. Membership income increased by 15%, while global advertising increased by 46%, with contributions from VIZIO. Walmart’s continued investment in artificial intelligence (AI) was a key highlight of the quarter. Walmart is developing AI-powered “super agents” to transform its operations and customer experience. Besides being a value stock, Walmart’s defensive nature also appeals to passive income investors during uncertain economic conditions. The company has earned the title of Dividend King by consistently increasing dividends over the last 53 years. Its dividend payout ratio of 32% suggests the dividends are sustainable for now. Overall, on Wall Street, Walmart stock has earned a “Strong Buy” rating. Out of the 37 analysts covering WMT stock, 30 have a “Strong Buy” recommendation, six rate it a “Moderate Buy,” and one recommends it is a “Hold.” Its average price target of $112.92 suggests upside potential of 17.5% from current levels. Its Street-high estimate of $127 implies potential upside of about 32.2% in the next 12 months. The Case for Target Stock Valued at $44.1 billion, Target is a large American retail chain that sells a wide range of products, including clothing, groceries, electronics, home goods, and household essentials, both in physical stores and online. It is known for its low prices, trendy merchandise, and easy one-stop shopping experience. On Aug. 20, along with the second quarter results, Target announced that the company is entering a pivotal new chapter as long-time CEO Brian Cornell prepares to hand over the reins to Michael Fiddelke, the chief operating officer, effective Feb. 1, 2026. The leadership change occurs at a time when the retail giant is dealing with tariff volatility and consumer shifts. A sudden C-Suite leadership change, combined with an internal transition, spooked investors, causing Target’s stock to plummet. Target’s stock is down 29% so far this year. During the earnings call, incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke acknowledged, “We’re not realizing our full potential right now.” He outlined three priorities for returning Target to profitable growth: establishing merchandising authority, improving the guest experience, and leveraging technology and speed. In the second quarter, net sales fell 0.9% year on year to $25.2 billion. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were $2.05, down from $2.57 the previous year, with management attributing the majority of the decrease to tariffs and inventory costs. Looking ahead, Target reaffirmed its full-year guidance for low single-digit comp declines and adjusted EPS of $7 to $9, compared to $8.86 in 2024. The consensus earnings estimate is $7.40 per share for the year. Target also has a reputation as a Dividend King, having increased dividends for 54 consecutive years, with the most recent increase of 1.8% to $1.14 per common share. It has a dividend yield of 4.8%, which is higher than both Walmart’s yield of 0.98% and the consumer staples sector average of 1.89%. Its payout ratio of 57.1% is also reasonable, leaving room for expansion. During the earnings call, the current CEO also reminded investors of Target’s structural advantages, which include nearly 2,000 well-located stores in all 50 states and a $31 billion owned brand portfolio. In addition, the company has partnerships with world-class companies such as Apple (AAPL) and Starbucks (SBUX), and it operates one of the largest loyalty programs in the country, Target Circle. These assets, combined with a profitable and growing digital business, provide a solid foundation for Target’s next phase under new leadership. Overall, Wall Street holds a cautious stance on TGT stock, rating it a “Hold.” Of the 35 analysts covering the stock, eight analysts rate it a “Strong Buy,” with three rating it a “Moderate Buy,” 19 rating it a “Hold,” one suggesting a “Moderate Sell,” and four rating it a “Strong Sell.” The average target price of $108 implies upside potential of 11% from current levels. Plus, its high target price of $135 suggests the stock can rally as much as 39% over the next 12 months. Which Retail Stock Is the Better Buy? Walmart appears to be the safer, more reliable option. Its grocery dominance, investments in AI and automation, and expanding advertising business serve as strong growth drivers while remaining resilient during downturns. Furthermore, the company is a consistent dividend payer. For risk-averse investors looking for consistency, Walmart remains the clear choice.

Either they're too expensive, or their future's too cloudy, or they're clearly vulnerable. Or some combination of all three. It happens. This backdrop, however, only makes the small handful of names I'm still interested in all the more compelling. Here's a rundown of my top three picks among these prospects right now. 1. Roblox The video gaming business can be brutal, with the constant threat of a newer or better game displacing demand for an existing hit title. So when one particular game remains popular year after year, it pays to take notice. Roblox (RBLX -1.17%) is that game. OK, it's not a game as much as it is a platform where amateur game designers can create their own online game, and then allow other gamers to pay those designers for access to their virtual world. Last quarter alone, the company shelled out $316 million worth of fees to these game developers -- about 29% of total revenue of just under $1.1 billion, which was up 21% year over year. An average of 111.8 million different people played at least one Roblox game every day for the three-month stretch in question as well, up 41%. That's not the impressive part of the bullish thesis here, though. What's truly impressive is how long this company's been able to maintain this sort of growth in an industry where demand for a particular game is relatively short-lived. See, Roblox was launched in 2006. It's pretty much grown every year since then, with no end in sight. The key to this growth is the nature of the platform itself; players always have a new experience, because developers are forever building new virtual worlds or updating their existing game rooms. Of course, it doesn't hurt that many of these online worlds have turned into something of a community for their fans. Now, as the graphic shows, Roblox isn't yet profitable -- one of the nuances that can make the stock a bit unpredictable. The company lost $280 million last quarter, in fact, up 34% from the loss reported for the comparable quarter a year earlier. The analyst community seems pretty convinced Roblox is turning the profit corner though, with losses expected to start shrinking beginning next year. Even though actual net profits are still years down the road, the vast majority of analysts still currently rate this ticker a strong buy based on this eventual distant swing to a profit. 2. Apple Yes, Apple (AAPL 2.04%) missed the mark with its foray into the consumer-facing artificial intelligence (AI) arena. Although the buzz surrounding Apple Intelligence when it was introduced last June was palpable then, what was released in October was underwhelming, by virtue of missing many of its touted features. It was also only available on the very newest of iPhones, which most iPhone fans didn't yet own (and still don't). Worse, the company now reports that the AI-powered version of Siri it wished it had released late last year now won't be ready for launch until early next year. And shareholders have paid the price. The stock's currently trading about where they were a year ago. For investors, that can take what they've learned about Apple over the course of the past 20 years and use it to predict what's likely for the next 20 though, this temporary weakness is a buying opportunity. The fact is, Apple on a bad day is still a better investment than most other stocks on their best day. Sure, the company made a mistake. It's capable of correcting it though, and is willing to do so. Indeed, there's a case to be made that the somewhat embarrassing gaffe ensures Apple will do everything in its power to impress the world when it gets a second chance to do so in the months ahead. The opportunity is enormous, too. Although most personal uses of AI right now are for more efficient web-browsing rather than actual improved personal efficiency, the software and underlying hardware capable of running it are still finding their footing. As refinements in both continue to be made, Precedence Research believes the worldwide intelligent virtual assistant market will grow at an average annualized pace of 24% through 2034. This growth is likely to be led by North America too, where iPhones are particularly popular. 3. Pfizer Finally, I'm adding Pfizer (PFE 1.18%) to the list of my three favorite stocks to buy right now. If you know anything at all about the pharmaceutical company then you almost certainly know the drugmaker's struggled since the wind-down of the COVID-19 pandemic. While its treatment (called Paxlovid) along with the vaccine it co-developed with BioNTech led the company to record-breaking revenue of $100 billion in 2022, last year's top line of $63.6 billion underscores how much the pharma giant has struggled to offset the loss of those pandemic-prompted sales. That's why the stock's now down nearly 60% from its late-2021 peak. As the old adage goes, though, it's always darkest before dawn. Translation: This steep and prolonged sell-off is a buying opportunity. What's not being priced in by backwards-looking investors is all that Pfizer has done in the meantime to rekindle its revenue growth. Between 2022's acquisitions of Biohaven Pharmaceuticals and Arena Pharmaceuticals, along with 2023's acquisition of Seagen at the same time, it's continued the development of drugs that were already in its own pipeline, and the company aims to have eight new blockbuster oncology drugs alone on the market by 2030. And that's just cancer. All told, Pfizer's got 28 different phase 3 drug trials underway right now, any and all of which could be approved by then. In the meantime, the pharmaceutical giant is en route to culling more than $7 billion in annual operating expenses by 2027. It's going to be a while before this company reaches the $100 billion annual revenue mark again. The sellers have arguably overshot their target though, dragging Pfizer stock down to less than 10 times this year's expected per-share earnings of $3.08, and pumping up its dividend yield (based on a reasonably well-protected dividend, by the way) up to nearly 6.7%. You're being pretty well-rewarded in the meantime while waiting for the rest of the market to figure out this iconic pharma company's still got plenty of upside ahead."
00cb40456922a5b8a32b727a56956b401f4b257200cebf0ddca2d4655ea81434,AAPL,"As Block Launches New Bitcoin Mining Tools , Is XYZ Stock a Buy , Sell , or Hold ? ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/block-launches-bitcoin-mining-tools-161831802.html,finance.yahoo.com,20250822T031500Z,semi,0.65,"Bitcoin (BTCUSD) has retraced to the $115,000 level. Following BTC’s all-time high above $124,000 last week — fueled by dovish Federal Reserve rate-cut expectations and dollar weakness — the cryptocurrency is facing a technical pullback amid macroeconomic headwinds, including tempered rate-cut optimism and Treasury signals against expanding U.S. crypto reserves. With supply nearing its limit and institutional inflows rising, Bitcoin’s current consolidation reflects a recalibration, balancing volatility with structural demand. Long-term investors view it as an opportunity, while short-term traders navigate tight ranges, setting the stage for potential re-acceleration as the market matures and corporate crypto strategies deepen. At the center of it all is BTC mining, the energy-intensive process where powerful computers solve complex puzzles to verify transactions and release new coins. That’s where the fintech powerhouse Block (XYZ) enters. Known for Square, Cash App, Afterpay, TIDAL, and crypto ventures like Bitkey and Proto, Block recently launched Proto Rig, a modular mining system, and Proto Fleet, open-source management software, designed to cut costs, extend hardware life, and streamline operations. So, does Block’s mining push signal long-term upside? Or is caution the wiser move? About Block Stock Block is Jack Dorsey’s fintech vision turned reality — a company weaving together Square’s merchant tools, Cash App’s banking ease, Afterpay’s buy now pay later (BNPL) service flexibility, TIDAL’s artist empowerment, and crypto ventures like Bitkey and Proto. Its mission is to expand global economic access. From payments to music to Bitcoin mining, Block is not just building apps. It is creating an interconnected ecosystem where money, commerce, and creativity flow more freely for sellers, consumers, and creators worldwide. Its market capitalization currently stands at $45.7 billion. Shares of XYZ have been on a roller coaster ride, full of ups and downs. From its 52-week peak of $99.26, the stock has tumbled under the weight of higher interest rates, profitability concerns, stiffening competition, and shaky macroeconomic sentiment. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, XYZ stock is still down 15%. Step back, however, and the picture looks brighter, with shares up 11% over the past year. In the near term, momentum is building as well. Over just the last three months, XYZ stock has surged 26%, hinting at a potential turnaround story in motion. Block’s valuation reads like a discount sale in a pricey neighborhood, trading at 1.9 times sales. For investors with the stomach to ride near-term turbulence, the setup whispers “undervalued” for long-haul investors. XYZ is not screaming cheap, but in a frothy fintech landscape, this looks like a risk worth underwriting. A Closer Look at Block’s Q2 Results Block's second-quarter earnings report, released on Aug. 7, told a mixed story. Revenue came in at $6.05 billion, down 1.6% year-over-year (YOY) and shy of Wall Street’s target. However, adjusted EPS rose 32% annually to $0.62. Beneath the top-line miss, gross profit surged 14% YOY to $2.5 billion, outpacing analyst estimates and proving Block’s core engines are humming. Square, Block’s original business, handled $64.25 billion in gross payment volume (GPV), up 10% YOY. That’s no small feat considering its competitors like Toast (TOST) and Fiserv’s (FI) Clover are clawing for market share. Meanwhile, Cash App is maturing into something more than a peer-to-peer wallet. Some 8 million users now treat it as their primary bank, generating more profit than average users. Add Borrow, Block’s fast-growing lending arm with $18 billion in annualized originations, and one can start to see the financial ecosystem CEO Jack Dorsey is building. Never one to shy from tech bets, Dorsey highlighted how internal artificial intelligence (AI) tools like “Goose” are reshaping Block’s DNA. Developers are shipping products like Cash App Pools, a group money-pooling feature that even works with Apple's (AAPL) Apple Pay and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Pay. This product velocity is exactly what Block is betting on to keep ahead of rivals. On the Square side, fresh go-to-market pushes are delivering paybacks in just five to six quarters. New hardware like Square Handheld and AI-powered dashboards are positioning the brand to win across restaurants, retail, and services. Add $58 billion in Bitcoin transactions in Q2, and one has a company positioning itself at every intersection of digital money. Meanwhile, management lifted full-year gross profit guidance to $10.17 billion, implying 14% YOY growth, and forecast a healthy 20% adjusted operating margin. Q3 guidance looks solid, too, with gross profit growth pegged at 16%. But it’s not all smooth sailing. Q3 adjusted operating margins are expected to dip temporarily to 18% as Borrow scales, and rising processing costs will squeeze Square’s near-term profitability. Cash App’s user growth has also plateaued, forcing Block to double down on density and acquisition strategies. And expanding lending inevitably raises exposure to credit risk, even with its proprietary scoring model keeping losses under 3%. Analysts covering Block predict a 54% annual decline in Q3 EPS to $0.26. Looking ahead to fiscal 2025, the bottom line is anticipated to be $1.03 per share, down 69% YOY. Still, that could rebound by 105% annually to $2.12 per share in fiscal 2026. Block’s Big Bet on Mining Efficiency As Bitcoin prices climb, efficiency in mining becomes even more critical, and that’s exactly where Block’s new tools come in. The Proto Rig is a modular mining machine that lets operators swap out individual hashboards instead of scrapping entire units. This shift transforms mining rigs from short-lived, three-to-five-year assets into decade-long infrastructure, slashing upgrade costs by 15% to 20% each cycle. Meanwhile, the Proto Fleet software unifies multiple management functions that miners previously juggled across different programs, streamlining operations, improving uptime, and cutting troubleshooting headaches. Together, these innovations address mining’s biggest pain points — high costs, downtime, and inefficient hardware. For Block, this is not just a product launch. It is a strategic play to capture market share as institutional adoption drives Bitcoin’s value higher. By making mining more sustainable and profitable, Block is positioning itself to ride the crypto boom while reinforcing its broader mission of expanding access to the digital economy. What Do Analysts Expect for Block Stock? Investor sentiment has been highly active around XYZ stock following the company's Q2 results, with analysts offering significant commentary on its performance. Mizuho lifted its price target to $88 from $71 and maintained an “Outperform” rating. The firm sees Square’s point-of-sale volumes surging, especially in the $500,000 cohort, calling Square the “comeback kid of 2025.” Argus joined the optimism and wasn’t far behind, boosting its target to $84 from $59, crediting strong momentum in restaurants and retail, plus margin expansion, and saying the S&P 500 inclusion only sweetens the deal. Jefferies took a slightly cooler stance on XYZ stock, trimming its target to $90 from $95 while sticking with a “Buy"" rating. The firm likes Square’s U.S. growth trajectory but flagged Cash App’s growing reliance on lending as a concern. Overall, the Street sees Block making a real comeback story with Square, but the jury is still out on whether Cash App’s lending push fuels growth or risk. XYZ stock has an overall “Moderate Buy” rating. Among the 43 analysts covering shares, 26 recommend a “Strong Buy,” four analysts advise a “Moderate Buy,” eight stay on the sidelines with a “Hold” rating, and five analysts have a “Strong Sell."" Block’s mean price target of $82.39 hints at 12% upside potential from here. The Street-high target of $105 implies that XYZ stock could rally as much as 43%.

But that 2005 rec, now Stock Advisor's all-time top performer, leaves the market in the dust with a return of 107,479% as of this writing. That is not a typo. Nvidia is the first Stock Advisor pick to grow more than 1,000 times in value! While it's easy to highlight a winner, the real challenge was having the patience to hold Nvidia shares through every bout of uncertainty over the years. What lessons could we learn from the most successful outlier in our flagship service? Quite a few. Despite its impressive returns, holding onto Nvidia wasn't a walk in the park. Let's explore what it truly takes to achieve a 1,000x return. At a Glance The Good A Stock That Has Doubled 10 Times The Rule of 72 is a simple way to estimate how long it takes for an investment to double. If a stock grows 9% a year, roughly the historical return of the stock market, it would take eight years (72 / 9) to double an investment. Now, imagine your favorite stocks are horses running a race around a track. Each time they complete a lap, they double in value. Knowing that the stock market as a whole might take nearly a decade to double, which horses would you bet on? In this race, the horses don't stop running, and you can choose to back those clearly leading the pack -- including Nvidia, which has now finished 10 laps of doubling since 2005, with 9 of those laps taking 2.5 years or less. Many investors might have hesitated to buy Nvidia, waiting for a pullback after seeing it double time and again. However, those who waited often found themselves still sidelined, missing out on its phenomenal growth. Anchoring to past prices is common, but in this endless race, wouldn't you prefer to back the horse consistently lapping the field? As David Gardner wisely notes, five harmful words for investors are, ""I guess I missed it."" The next doubling for Nvidia would require another $4 trillion in value, a feat that might not seem as far-fetched in the future. Excluding PetroChina's brief brush with a trillion-dollar valuation in 2007, Apple (AAPL 2.04%) founded the trillion-dollar club in August 2018 before reaching the $2 trillion and $3 trillion thresholds in 2020 and 2023, respectively. Nvidia broke the $4 trillion barrier earlier in July, with Microsoft (MSFT 0.50%) joining on Wednesday. There's no guarantee that Nvidia will ever get to $8 trillion or $16 trillion -- let alone get there first -- but it does have the inside lane. More Years of Doubling Than Down Years One fun stat I've stumbled upon while following Nvidia comes courtesy of 1stock1.com, a website listing calendar-year returns as well as pre-split pricing (which I'll mention again later). Including the partial year of its 1999 IPO, Nvidia has enjoyed 10 calendar years with gains of 100% or more, while the stock fell by any amount in only 7 years so far. Nvidia isn't unique in this category -- Shopify (SHOP 0.86%) and The Trade Desk (TTD 0.18%) share the same distinction of having more years of 100% gains than of losses for now -- but it's noteworthy. The Winner Outweighing All the Losers Stock Advisor members have access to our complete scorecard, where each recommendation is tracked against the S&P 500 from the time it's selected until it's sold (or held through today). With two stock picks each month since 2002, we've seen hundreds of winners and losers along the way. This graphic illustrates the returns of all 562 Stock Advisor recommendations relative to their S&P 500 benchmark. David's April 2005 Nvidia selection leads with more than 106,000 percentage points of outperformance above the market's 726% return in the same period. Not all underperformers lost value; some, like FedEx's (FDX 0.38%) 403% gain since 2003, underwhelmed compared to the S&P's 959% over the same time frame. One standout like Nvidia can outweigh all the underperformers in Stock Advisor's storied history. David's 2009 Nvidia rerecommendation, along with two long-standing Netflix (NFLX 1.40%) recommendations, further highlights this point. But it gets better: The gain on the initial rec since April 15, 2025 -- the compounding just after the 20th anniversary -- nearly makes up for the hundreds of losing stock picks over the years. Nvidia exemplifies the Foolish principle of holding winners and not selling too early. Yet its journey wasn't always smooth. A stock that seems today to be taking a long victory lap once appeared to be slowly circling the drain. The Bad The Stock That Plummeted 85% Imagine a stock falling 80%. It might invoke thoughts of high-growth investments facing challenges or an unfavorable interest rate climate, perhaps echoing bad memories of 2021 or 2022. If you remember the 2000s, you might recall that something big happened in the market before the end of the decade. The first Nvidia rec quintupled by 2007 only to lose all those gains in mere months. If it needs to be repeated, this is a chapter in the greatest stock story of the last 20 years. The 85% plummet was the steepest for Nvidia shares since 2005, but seeing it trade significantly below previous highs was common for shareholders over the last 20-odd years. On average, Nvidia spent its time on our scorecard 34% below its then-highs. If we count days on which the stock closed more than 20% below its historic high price, Nvidia was in its own bear market more than 59% of the time! Let that marinate for a moment. We all wish for a time machine so we could go back and buy Nvidia stock decades in the past. But if you had owned shares at that time, would you honestly have held through to today? After all, the discomfort wasn't limited to the sharp pangs of these low points. There was also a dull pain that lasted for years. The Lost Decade On October 17, 2007, Nvidia closed at an all-time high. The next day, shares declined, and the record high was not reset until May 15, 2016. There's a reason the Fool encourages investors to hold stocks for five years or more. Periods of volatility or apparent mispricing can persist much longer than most investors (and all traders) are willing to wait. Could you sit on your hands while a stock was 85% underwater after six months or 50% in the red after the better part of a decade, waiting like a good Foolish investor should? And after all of those years waiting to break even, would you cut ties as soon as shares rose in spring 2016 back to prices of more than eight years earlier? If that sounds like something you might have done, I have some bad news. Guess which Fool rec was the best-performing stock in the entire S&P 500 in 2016? That would be Nvidia, of course, the dog many investors sold along the way. It gained 227% that year, before David recommended it for a third time in January 2017. The Ugly Holding Leads to Portfolio Concentration Nothing is quite as unpleasant as several years of dismal returns, but what differentiates Foolish investing outcomes is often a willingness to sit in your own discomfort and build the long-term-investor mindset when the short run looks bleak. That involves challenging conventional wisdom. I suspect most investors wouldn't believe the following: - A large cap worth $40 billion in 2016 could grow 100x in the next nine years. - A mega cap worth $400 billion in 2022 could grow 10x in just three years. - An investor who sold at the 2007 peak and who successfully avoided the 85% drop would have missed out on 17,660% gains if they stayed on the sidelines. - An investor who locked in gains by selling half their position when Nvidia first doubled and stayed in with ""house money"" has now given up 54,689% of the gains they could have earned. The greatest mistake we make as investors is selling our winners too early. The opportunity cost of those mistakes compounds over time as well, but that doesn't mean you should never sell. While the pullback in Nvidia's stock price during the great financial crisis was much deeper from prior highs than any drop since, relatively smaller recent drawdowns had much larger dollar impacts for anyone who has held many years. The 37% pullback between January and April meant that the earliest Nvidia rec dropped from being a 910-bagger to a 574-bagger, temporarily losing 336 times an original investment. We know now that Nvidia went on to greater heights within months, but a concentrated position without any allocation guardrails would have become a major risk. You have more flexibility to set your own sleep number and trim overweight positions than the Stock Advisor team has on our scorecard. It's possible that we could someday keep Nvidia as a high-conviction buy recommendation while at the same time closing one or two of the active recs as a reminder of prudent portfolio management rather than as a statement of near-term outlooks or overvaluation. The Thesis Had to Evolve In the 1990s, our Chief Rule Breaker actually rooted against Nvidia, seeing it as a rival to his preferred video game graphics card company, 3Dfx. By 2005, Nvidia had acquired 3Dfx, and David's investment thesis focused on Nvidia's growth potential with Microsoft's Xbox and Motorola (MSI 1.78%) cellphones. Cloud computing and data centers, now Nvidia's largest business segment, were nonexistent. Cryptocurrency mining hadn't been invented yet, and artificial intelligence was absent from the original vision. Even CEO Jensen Huang's enduring leadership wasn't part of David's initial analysis. While some investment theses remain straightforward -- perhaps selling more shoes or opening more coffee shops -- the biggest winners have a quality we call optionality. You might foresee that an online bookseller like Amazon (AMZN -0.61%) could become ""the everything store"" or that Netflix could pivot from mailed DVDs to video streaming. It's crucial to look ahead, acknowledging that successful investments might differ greatly from their original business models. But reevaluating your understanding of your investments is easier said than done, and it might take some extra homework to stay comfortable holding onto developing winners. The Penny Stock That Wasn't Nvidia's 2005 cost basis on our scorecard is just $0.16, at least until it's adjusted further lower due to dividends or future stock splits. One of the biggest mistakes new investors often make is to see data like this and presume the only place to hunt for multibaggers is among penny stocks. The reason for that misdirection is stock splits. Nvidia has never traded in penny-stock territory since 2005 due to four splits: - April 2006: 2-for-1 split - September 2007: 3-for-2 split - July 2021: 4-for-1 split - June 2024: 10-for-1 split If you followed the April 2005 recommendation, an investment of less than $20 per share would now translate to 120 shares for every 1 held since then. Without these splits, that single share would today be worth above $21,000. Nvidia would have the same market cap but far fewer shares outstanding. While fractional shares weren't available back then, today's investors can buy partial shares of many companies through their broker for as little as $5. For the same dollar amount invested, I'd rather own a fraction of a strong business like Nvidia than thousands of shares of a failing one trading over the counter for pennies. The Foolish Bottom Line Nvidia has been a mainstay on Stock Advisor's Foundational Stocks list since 2022 and is likely to remain a Fool favorite for years to come. If you don't own shares directly, know that almost $8 out of every $100 invested in an S&P index fund is tied to Nvidia, its largest weight today. And those who have followed our recommendation for years might own more than enough already, which shifts the question of whether to buy to when to pare down an oversize position in the years ahead. (That's how I'm thinking through the 70x gains on the first block of shares I bought in 2017.) As I wrote above, there's no guarantee Nvidia will continue to be the market darling it has been for so long. But if there's one idea I would take to the bank -- one premise I'm nearly certain about -- it's that Nvidia isn't done teaching Fools lessons about long-term thinking that will pay dividends across all the other investments we consider on our investing journeys. If you haven't held Nvidia since 2005, it's not too late to collect a small slice of one of the highest-quality businesses in the world. And if you have... take that victory lap. You've earned it.

Notably, Apple has emerged as the worst-performing member of the Magnificent Seven in 2025, with shares down approximately 16% year‑to‑date (YTD). While sluggish growth, limited artificial intelligence (AI) monetization, and tariff-related headwinds have surfaced, some analysts view the current dip as a buying opportunity based on Apple’s ecosystem strengths. Meanwhile, others express concerns about AAPL, citing its premium valuation amidst uncertain catalysts. So, is Apple stock poised for a turnaround? Or is now the moment to sell, or simply hold and wait? About Apple Stock Headquartered in California, Apple is a futuristic company and a global leader across hardware, software, and services, including flagship products such as the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and services like the App Store, iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple TV+. Apple commands a market capitalization of $3.1 trillion, ranking as the world’s third-most valuable public company, trailing only Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) . AAPL stock’s performance in 2025 has been notably disappointing, with shares falling and underperforming its elite group. While Nvidia, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms (META) have posted gains of at least 20% or more YTD, Apple has lagged as investor concerns mount over soft iPhone sales (particularly in China), and broader macroeconomic challenges. Nevertheless, over the past month, AAPL stock has gained 2%, signaling a potentially revived interest among investors and tentative stabilization. Despite the downslide, AAPL is still trading at a premium at 30 times forward earnings, compared to the sector median and its historical average. Apple Delivered Stable Q2 Performance Apple unveiled its second-quarter 2025 results on May 1. For the period, Apple reported revenue of $95.4 billion, a 5% year-over-year (YOY) increase, and EPS of $1.65, up nearly 8% from the previous year. The company’s Services segment delivered strong momentum, growing 11.6% YOY to a record high of $26.6 billion, while Product sales rose 2.7%, led by modest gains in iPhone and Mac, and impressive iPad growth of around 15.2%. Wearables, Home and Accessories declined 4.9% compared to the year-ago quarter, as last year’s Vision Pro launch created a high comparative base. Apple acknowledged persistent headwinds from U.S.‑China trade tensions and tariff-related issues. In response, the company continues to shift iPhone production to India and other product lines to Vietnam to mitigate exposure and diversify its supply chain. Apple is expected to report its Q3 earnings results on Thursday, July 31, after the market closes. Management guides for low‑to‑mid single‑digit annual revenue growth for the quarter, with gross margins expected to be between 45.5% and 46.5%, while incorporating the estimated $900 million tariff impact. Analysts covering Apple predict that the company’s Q3 EPS will rise by 1.4% YOY to $1.42. Further, the consensus estimate of $7.11 for fiscal 2025 indicates an increase of 5.3% YOY, before improving by around 8% annually to $7.69 in fiscal 2026. Spotlight on the iOS 26 Beta Preview Apple recently released the public beta version of its upcoming iPhone operating system, iOS 26, offering users an early look at what’s to come ahead of the official rollout this fall. The update introduces “Liquid Glass,” a major redesign of the user interface that replaces traditional buttons and menus with translucent, responsive, animated elements, marking the most significant visual overhaul since iOS 7 in 2013. In addition to aesthetic changes, iOS 26 brings several new features, including a revamped Phone app that merges recent calls and voicemails, enhanced spam call and text filtering, real-time translation in iMessage and FaceTime, and more. However, the highly anticipated Siri upgrades promised in 2024 are notably missing and are now expected no earlier than 2026, which was a disappointment for investors. What Do Analysts Expect for Apple Stock? Analysts remain divided on Apple stock, reflecting a mix of cautious skepticism and bullish conviction as the company navigates AI delays and competitive pressures. Citi analysts reaffirmed a “Buy” rating with a $240 price target, citing confidence in iPhone unit sales growth in the June quarter. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs recently reiterated its “Buy” stance with a price target of $253, indicating a cautiously bullish outlook amid a volatile macro backdrop. On the other hand, Jefferies has taken a more cautious tone. It has upgraded Apple from an “Underperform” to a “Hold,” raising the target from $170.62 to $188.32. The upgrade was driven by expected strong revenues in Q3, boosted by tariff-driven pull-in demand and China market recovery. However, Jefferies warned that the iPhone 17 lacks compelling new features and may lead to flat unit growth in the second half. AAPL stock has a consensus “Moderate Buy” rating overall, indicating confidence tempered with caution. Out of 37 analysts covering the tech stock, 18 recommend a “Strong Buy,” three give a “Moderate Buy,” 14 analysts stay cautious with a “Hold” rating, and two have a “Strong Sell” rating. The average analyst price target for AAPL is $231.46, indicating potential upside of 10%. Meanwhile, the Street-high target price of $300 suggests as much as 44% upside from current levels.

(AAPL) is one of the world’s largest technology companies, renowned for its innovative consumer electronics, software, and digital services. Headquartered in Cupertino, California, Apple designs, manufactures, and markets products such as the iPhone, iPad, Mac computers, Apple Watch, and AirPods. Its software ecosystem includes iOS, macOS, watchOS, and services like the App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, and Apple TV+. Shares of this tech giant have underperformed the broader market over the past year. AAPL has declined 1.8% over this time frame, while the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has rallied nearly 17.1%. Additionally, in 2025, AAPL stock is down 14.5%, compared to SPX’s 8.6% rise on a YTD basis. More News from Barchart Zooming in further, AAPL has also lagged behind the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLK). The exchange-traded fund has gained about 22.1% over the past year and 13.6% in 2025. Shares of AAPL surged marginally on Jul. 25 after the company released the beta version of iOS 26, marking the biggest iPhone software update since iOS 7 in 2013. For the current fiscal year, ending in September, analysts expect AAPL’s EPS to grow 5.3% to $7.11 on a diluted basis. The company’s earnings surprise history is impressive. It beat the consensus estimate in each of the last four quarters. Among the 37 analysts covering AAPL stock, the consensus is a “Moderate Buy.” That’s based on 18 “Strong Buy” ratings, three “Moderate Buys,” 14 “Holds,” and two “Strong Sells.” This configuration is less bullish than three months ago, with 19 analysts suggesting a “Strong Buy.” On July 26, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) lowered its price target for Apple from $240 to $230, citing weaker demand expectations for the iPhone 17 and ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. While Analyst Samik Chatterjee maintained an “Overweight” rating, he sees reduced volume for the iPhone 17, forecasting 85 million units in 2025, down 9% from the iPhone 16. However, he anticipates a stronger iPhone 18 cycle, potentially featuring a foldable design and enhanced AI features. The mean price target of $231.46 represents an 8.1% premium to AAPL’s current price levels. The Street-high price target of $300 suggests an ambitious upside potential of 40.2%.

Three years ago, approximately zero people could have predicted that Nvidia would become the largest company in the world. Apple (AAPL 2.04%) held that title, valued at $2.28 trillion, while Nvidia was valued at a more modest $298 billion. But after unprecedented artificial intelligence (AI) demand, Nvidia has rocketed higher and holds the title of the world's largest company by a healthy margin. Investors can't go back in time and invest in Nvidia, but they can project out three years to see where Nvidia can go from here. I think there are two major possibilities, with one outcome being more likely than the other. Let's take a look at where Nvidia is headed, and that may clue investors in on what they should do with the stock now. Massive AI demand will continue to drive Nvidia's stock gains Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs), which have the unique ability to process multiple calculations in parallel. This attribute makes them perfectly suited for processing arduous workloads like gaming graphics, engineering simulations, mining cryptocurrency, and training artificial intelligence models. The current generation of generative AI models has been trained on Nvidia GPUs, making them vital pieces of hardware in the AI value chain. This has led to unprecedented revenue and profit growth for Nvidia. With growth levels like that, investors may be wondering if there's still juice left in the tank. Luckily, there is. AI hyperscalers have announced multiple deals with Nvidia and its partners that will once again set a record in data center capital expenditures during 2026. This bodes well for Nvidia, but investors are growing increasingly concerned that Nvidia may be losing some market share. The two biggest culprits are AMD (AMD -0.52%) and Broadcom (AVGO -1.24%). AMD recently signed a major deal with OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, signaling to other AI companies that AMD's products are competitive with Nvidia's, something that hasn't been the case. This could cause some companies to deploy some cheaper AMD hardware, which could result in market loss for Nvidia. Broadcom's computing units aren't a direct replacement for Nvidia's GPUs. Instead, they make custom AI accelerator chips that are designed in collaboration with the end user. This makes them impossible to obtain if you're a relatively small company (unless you rent them through the cloud). Still, the AI hyperscalers have plenty of resources to partner with Broadcom to make these chips viable. Broadcom's custom AI chips can outperform Nvidia's GPUs at a lower cost point, but that comes at the price of flexibility, because Broadcom's chips are designed with only one workload in mind. Both of these are threats to Nvidia's market dominance, which has been estimated to be about a 90% market share. Despite both of these factors, Nvidia is still the most popular computing unit to train and run AI models on, and it will still be in a great position for the next wave of AI spending. AI spending is projected to reach multitrillion-dollar levels Many investors were skeptical when Nvidia stated during its Q2 earnings call that global data center capital expenditures would reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030. However, that bold projection was quickly followed up by multiple Wall Street firms guiding for similar or increased amounts of AI spending over the next few years. This will bode well for Nvidia, especially with Nvidia estimating that global data center capital expenditures will total around $600 billion this year. That indicates a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 42%, which could directly translate into Nvidia sustaining its rapid growth rate over this time frame. Should Nvidia deliver 40% growth over the next five years and maintain its current valuation, that would transform Nvidia from a $4.58 trillion business into nearly a $25 trillion giant. A company of that size is hard to fathom, but if the AI market grows at projected rates and Nvidia maintains its market share, that's where it's heading. If that's the case, then Nvidia is a screaming buy right now. There's also the possibility that these projections are wrong and AI spending decreases, or that Nvidia loses substantial market share. I don't see the latter happening, but the former is always possible. If that's the case, Nvidia's shares will likely plummet in response to decreased AI spending. We've barely scratched the surface of what an AI-first society looks like, making me inclined to believe that the spending projections are real. Time will tell, but if those projections pan out, then Nvidia is a must-buy at these levels."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is among the 14 Best Big Name Stocks to Invest in Right Now. On October 16, Evercore ISI maintained its Outperform rating and price target of $290 for the stock. This is a reaffirmation of their earlier update on September 26, in which they hiked the stock’s price target from $260, following Evercore’s annual survey of approximately 4,000 consumers in the United States about their intentions to purchase the iPhone. The analysts told investors that the survey’s results pointed to the beginning of a better-than-anticipated iPhone refresh cycle, driven by a strong line of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) products. Evercore further stated the tech giant’s core strength was still concentrated in the Pro tiers. However, they also believe that iPhone 17 might have exceeded initial expectations with robust sales during its first week. The price target of $290 represents an 18% upside from the stock’s closing value on October 15. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is known for its consumer electronics, software, and other related products. Its premium line of products, which includes the iPhone, iPad, Mac computers, and a range of other accessories, has earned the company widespread acclaim and customer loyalty. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/expensive-not-nutty-howard-marks-134100373.html,finance.yahoo.com,20251016T220000Z,semi,0.65,"‘Expensive, but not nutty.’ Howard Marks on U.S. stocks and the one thing investors should be doing right now. Barbara Kollmeyer 7 min read The direction is upward for stocks on Wednesday, driven by some optimism around Fed rate cuts, as investors continue fielding rumblings on the U.S.-China trade front. Taking a step back is our call of the day from the highly respected co-founder of Oaktree Capital Management, Howard Marks, who says U.S. markets remain an unbeatable place to invest, but some caution is warranted. “Money wants to be in the United States. It’s hard to think of another destination as your capital, which is superior. Other destinations may be cheaper, but I don’t think the macro environment is better,” he said during a videoconference appearance at the Cathay Asset Management Conference in Taipei on Wednesday. He described U.S. investors, though, as “happy, relatively carefree, and maybe complacent,” he said, adding that “markets in the U.S., but in most places, are dominated by optimism, not pessimism. And when you have optimism ruling the market, then you get high prices relative to value, and that’s where we are.” Marks made similar points in an August memo, saying while “Magnificent Seven” stocks don’t look overvalued, those for the rest of the S&P 500 SPX was concerning. He pointed to a JPMorgan chart from late last year that looked at what an investor’s annual return on average over the next 10 years would be if they had bought S&P 500 at a given price/earnings ratio. The P/E was 23 at the time, meaning that average return would be 2% to minus 2%, he said. “In other words, the S&P 500 is expensive, and if past relationships hold, you should not expect much of a return if you buy it when it’s 23. And by the way, that was at the end of last year. The S&P has gone up from there and the S&P P/E ratio is now higher,” making it “definitely expensive,” he added. The forward P/E ratio for the S&P 500 currently sits at 22.7 times, according to FactSet. However, Marks acknowledged that today’s companies, such as the dominant “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks, are “better,” as he cited solid products, strong growth, “huge incremental profitability” and dominance in their industries that keeps the competition at bay. Nodding to worries over an AI stock bubble, he said it remains to be seen whether current equity prices are too high or not high enough for those companies. “My conclusion on the U.S. stock market has been that it is expensive, but not nutty,” he said. With that, Marks offers some advice. “As investors, we sometimes know what’s going to happen. We never know when, but if the market is expensive we have to say so and take action and maybe raise our defenses a little bit,” he said. In his August note to investors, the Oaktree co-founder discussed the value of progressively applying his so-called Investment Readiness Conditions, set up to mimic the Pentagon’s Defense Readiness Conditions that range from DEFCON 5 to top danger at DEFCON 1. His so-called “Invescons” are as follows: 6. Stop buying 5. Reduce aggressive holdings and increase defensive holdings 4. Sell off the remaining aggressive holdings 3. Trim defensive holdings as well 2. Eliminate all holdings 1. Go short “I’ve been around for 56 years. I’ve never been certain enough to go to one or two, but you know six, five, four, three make some sense. I think today is reasonable to be at number five,” he said. “I think people who have portfolios and have done well in a bullish, constructive environment with rising optimism, I think maybe it’s time to, depending on how you feel about wanting to be conservative, to take some chips off the table and shade your portfolio toward defensiveness.” Marks said investors these days should steady themselves and “participate in the long-run beneficial effects of being an investor and being an investor in the U.S.” An investor who can compound their money at 7% a year and before taxes that doubles every ten years, is doing “pretty good,” he said. “The key is not to have things in your portfolio or much in your portfolio that it’s so aggressive that a bad time can really thwart your efforts. Steadily making good returns, number one, beats swinging for the fences and number two, produces a much more comfortable way of being,” he said.

December E-mini S&P futures (ESZ25) are up +1.22%, and December E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQZ25) are up +1.76%. Stock indexes are sharply higher today as they recover some of the losses from last Friday's plunge. Asset markets are rebounding today after the Trump administration softened its rhetoric toward China. There is no trading in cash Treasuries today due to the Columbus Day holiday. The price of gold is up more than +2% today and has posted a new all-time high due to central bank buying, expectations for additional Fed rate cuts, and safe-haven demand from the US government shutdown, threats to the Fed's independence, global trade tensions, and geopolitical risks. The Trump administration signaled openness on Sunday to a trade deal with China in an attempt to ease trade tensions. Stocks plunged last Friday after President Trump threatened 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and restrictions on US software exports, effective November 1, in retaliation for China's sweeping new curbs on exports of rare-earth materials and related technology. Trade news from China was better than expected, a positive sign for global economic growth and a bullish factor for the stock market. China Sep exports rose +8.3% y/y, stronger than expectations of +6.6% y/y and the biggest increase in six months. Also, Sep imports rose +6.4% y/y, stronger than expectations of +1.8% y/y and the largest increase in 17 months. Most stock indexes rallied to record highs last week on optimism that growth in the AI sector and spending on artificial intelligence will translate into corporate profits. Stocks are also underpinned by hopes that a resilient US economy and additional Fed easing will continue to support the economy. The shutdown of the US government continues, weighing on market sentiment and delaying key economic reports. The government shutdown means delays in the release of government reports, including the last two weeks of weekly initial unemployment claims, the Aug US trade report, and the Sep nonfarm payrolls report. Last Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said that it will release the September consumer price report on October 24 if the government shutdown continues into Wednesday, when the Sep CPI report is scheduled for release. The White House has warned that if the government shutdown lingered, it would trigger widespread dismissals of employees in government programs that don't align with President Trump's priorities. Bloomberg Economics estimates that 640,000 federal workers will be furloughed during the shutdown, which would expand jobless claims and push the unemployment rate up to 4.7%. The markets this week will focus on trade or tariff news and any attempts to reopen the government. On Tuesday, Fed Chair Powell delivers the keynote address at the NABE Annual Meeting. Also on Tuesday, major banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo & Co., will begin releasing their earnings results as the Q3 earnings season begins. Rising corporate earnings expectations are a bullish backdrop for stocks. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, more than 22% of companies in the S&P 500 provided guidance for their Q3 earnings results that are expected to beat analysts' expectations, the highest in a year. However, Q3 profits are expected to have risen by +7.2%, the smallest increase in two years. Also, Q3 sales growth is projected to slow to +5.9% from 6.4% in Q2. The markets are pricing in a 99% chance of a -25 bp rate cut at the next FOMC meeting on Oct 28-29. Overseas stock markets today are mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 is up +0.44%. China's Shanghai Composite fell to a 2.5-week low and closed down -0.19%. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 did not trade as markets in Japan are closed for the Health-Sports Day holiday. Interest Rates December 10-year T-notes (ZNZ5) today are down -3 ticks. Cash 10-year T-notes are not trading today, with the Treasury market closed for the Columbus Day holiday. Dec -T-notes are under pressure today from a sharp rebound in stocks, which curbs safe-haven demand for government debt securities. Losses in Dec T-notes are limited amid concerns about the ongoing US government shutdown, which could lead to additional job losses, reduced consumer spending, and a weakened US economy, potentially allowing the Fed to continue cutting interest rates. European government bond yields are moving lower today. The 10-year German bund yield fell to a 2-month low of 2.624% and is down -1.7 bp at 2.627%. The 10-year UK gilt yield fell to a 3-week low of 4.644% and is down -2.5 bp to 4.650%. The German Sep wholesale price index rose +1.2% y/y, the fastest pace in six months.

What happened According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission dated Oct. 7, 2025, GuoLine Advisory Pte Ltd reduced its position in KLA Corporation(KLAC 0.81%) by 22,900 shares in the third quarter of 2025. The estimated value of the shares sold was $21.4 million, based on the average price for the quarter ended September 30, 2025. The fund now holds 29,600 shares of KLA Corporation, valued at $31.93 million as of September 30, 2025. What else to know GuoLine’s sale brings its KLA stake to 3.2% of reportable AUM as of the third quarter of 2025, down from 5% in the prior quarter. Top holdings after the filing: - MSFT: $124.77 million (12.4% of AUM) - GOOGL: $120.58 million (12.0% of AUM) - AAPL: $94.65 million (9.4% of AUM) - AMZN: $62.73 million (6.3% of AUM) - ZS: $57.25 million (5.7% of AUM) As of Oct. 13, 2025, shares of KLA Corporation were priced at $1,139.71. The stock is up 56% YTD through Oct. 13, 2025, outperforming the S&P 500 by 43 percentage points during the same period. Company overview Company snapshot Offers process control, yield management, inspection, and metrology solutions for the semiconductor and electronics industries, including wafer inspection, reticle inspection, and PCB/display inspection systems. Generates revenue primarily through the sale of advanced inspection and metrology equipment, software solutions, and related services that support semiconductor manufacturing and quality control processes. Serves global semiconductor manufacturers, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and electronics producers seeking to enhance yield and process efficiency in high-volume manufacturing environments. KLA Corporation is a leading provider of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor industry, with a strong focus on advanced inspection and metrology technologies. The company leverages decades of expertise to support customers in achieving higher yields and improved manufacturing efficiency. Foolish take GuoLine Advisory recently sold off $21.4 million worth of KLA Corporation shares, which probably means it's just rebalancing its portfolio after a fantastic year for the semiconductor equipment company. Even with that sale, GuoLine still holds almost $32 million in KLA, hinting that it's still pretty confident and bullish about the company's future. The stock itself has had an amazing run, jumping 56% this year through Oct. 13, easily beating the S&P 500's 13% gain over the same period. KLA's strength comes from its crucial role in the semiconductor industry. Their inspection and metrology tools are essential for chipmakers to spot flaws and boost manufacturing efficiency–these technologies may become even more vital as chips get smaller and more intricate. With a history of consistent cash flow and smart execution, KLA has shown it can handle the ups and downs of the semiconductor world.

This Stock Has Made Far More Millionaires,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/should-you-forget-sirius-xm-holdings/?source=iedfolrf0000001,www.fool.com,20251013T130000Z,semi,0.65,"Once upon a time, satellite radio looked like a get-rich-quick scheme. The two predecessors of Sirius XM Holdings (SIRI 0.16%) made some people very rich in the second half of the 1990s, as new cars started shipping with satellite-enabled radios. But Sirius XM's stock peaked at the turn of the millennium, and longtime shareholders have seen share prices drop 97% from that ancient peak. A million dollars invested in Sirius XM on Feb. 17, 2000, would be worth roughly $32,000 on Oct. 10, 2025. With dividends reinvested along the way, you'd have a total return of $40,850 -- still a disastrous result in 25 years and change. With a plethora of media-streaming options and nearly ubiquitous access to high-speed internet connections, Sirius XM looks like an unlikely winner these days. I would much rather invest in a proven performer that made more millionaires than Sirius XM ever did -- and kept building their wealth for decades. In particular, I'm thinking about Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.70%) (BRK.B 0.78%). Sirius XM Holdings is losing its signal Just for fun, let's imagine investing $32,000 in Sirius Satellite Radio and another $32,000 in Berkshire Hathaway's Class B shares at the satellite radio veteran's peak in February 2000. As expected, the Sirius XM bet would have dropped to approximately $1,000 by now. Berkshire investors, on the other hand, would have nearly half a million dollars in their portfolio: Yeah, I'm hand-picking the worst possible time to buy Sirius XM stock, but the picture doesn't change much in other long-term spans. Berkshire's robust insurance operations and brilliant equity investments have generated market-beating annual returns over the last few decades, no matter how you slice them. Switching channels to Berkshire Hathaway's proven success Berkshire is like a mini-index or exchange-traded fund, all in one company. Its operations range from insurance (GEICO) and railroads (BNSF) to clothing (Fruit of the Loom) and batteries (Duracell). I'm sure you're familiar with these household-name brands. And that's just the wholly owned businesses fully under Berkshire Hathaway's control. Buffett's company also owns large stock investments in many public companies, putting Berkshire representatives in their boardroom. The largest holdings include Apple (AAPL 2.04%) and American Express (AXP 7.21%), which add up to 39.5% of Berkshire's stock portfolio right now. If you insist on some Sirius XM exposure, Berkshire will serve that purpose too. It holds a dominant stake in the satellite radio business, at 37.1% of Sirius XM's shares. Mind you, that's still a small commitment for Berkshire at 0.9% of its diversified stock portfolio. Berkshire Hathaway's stellar stability If you thought the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.53%) was a calm, safe, and stable investment option, Berkshire Hathaway beats the market index in some ways. - The stock has a beta value of 0.7, which means that it tends to be significantly less volatile than the broader market. - For example, the S&P 500 fell 2.7% last Friday, along with identical price drops in index funds like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO 0.60%) and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY 0.60%). Buffett's empire only fell 1.5% on the same tariff-escalation news. - Berkshire Hathaway's stock tends to outperform the market in the long run, though it should be said that the index funds can make up the difference with dividend payouts. The total returns are very similar in multi-year periods: Berkshire Hathaway's bench is as strong as its balance sheet If there ever was a great time to start a Berkshire Hathaway investment, this might be it. Check out the total returns of the last 6 months: The tiny peak in early May was Berkshire Hathaway's all-time high. It was also the last market day before Warren Buffett announced his retirement. The S&P 500 has soared since then while Berkshire investors missed the rally -- the pending exit of a legendary leader weighs heavily on the stock. But I have full confidence in incoming Berkshire Hathaway CEO Greg Abel and his fully intact team of executives, analysts, and portfolio managers. I can't imagine a better investing mentor than Warren Buffett, and Abel has served by his side for decades. Abel and others have executed many of Berkshire's investments in recent years, so it's really just an upgraded title. Not much should change in terms of business operations. And you can pick up Berkshire Hathaway shares at a discount while the market worries about this humble speed bump. Berkshire has made lots of millionaires over the decades while Sirius XM's wealth-building era was long ago and temporary. As with any rock-solid investment vehicle, adding money over time to a Berkshire Hathaway position could build a million-dollar portfolio for you, too."

December E-mini S&P futures (ESZ25) fell -2.61%, and December E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQZ25) fell -3.39%. Stock indexes gave up an early advance on Friday and sold off sharply, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 sliding to 2-week lows and the Dow Jones Industrials dropping to a 1-month low. Stocks plummeted as US trade tensions escalated with China after President Trump threatened a ""massive increase"" of tariffs on Chinese goods, citing China's recent ""hostile"" export controls on rare-earth minerals. Mr. Trump also said there seems to be no reason to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC meeting in South Korea later this month. Stocks initially moved higher on Friday, with the Nasdaq 100 posting a new all-time high. Lower bond yields initially supported stocks on Friday due to dovish comments from Fed Governor Christopher Waller and St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem when they said they supported additional Fed rate cuts. However, the declines in T-note yields accelerated as stocks slumped in response to President Trump's tariff threats, with the 10-year T-note yield falling to a three-week low of 4.04%. The University of Michigan US Oct consumer sentiment index fell -0.1 to a 5-month low of 55.0, stronger than expectations of 54.0. The University of Michigan US Oct 1-year inflation expectations unexpectedly fell -0.1 to 4.6%, versus expectations of no change at 4.7%. The Oct 5-10 year inflation expectations remained unchanged at 3.7%, right on expectations. Fed Governor Christopher Waller said, ""The labor market is weak,"" and he's open to quarter-point interest rate cuts at the coming FOMC meetings. St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem said that, ""Looking ahead, I am open-minded about a potential further reduction in interest rates to provide further insurance against labor market weakening."" Most stock indexes rallied to record highs this week on optimism that growth in the AI sector and spending on artificial intelligence will translate into corporate profits. Stocks are also underpinned by hopes that a resilient US economy and additional Fed easing will continue to support the economy. The shutdown of the US government is now into its second week, weighing on market sentiment and delaying key economic reports. The government shutdown means delays in the release of government reports, including the last two weeks of weekly initial unemployment claims, Tuesday's Aug US trade report, and last Friday's monthly payroll report. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on Friday said that it will release the September consumer price report on October 24 if the government shutdown continues into next week. The Sep CPI report is scheduled for release on October 15. The White House has warned that if the government shutdown lingered, it would trigger widespread dismissals of employees in government programs that don't align with President Trump's priorities. Bloomberg Economics estimates that 640,000 federal workers will be furloughed during the shutdown, which would expand jobless claims and push the unemployment rate up to 4.7%. Rising corporate earnings expectations are a bullish backdrop for stocks. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, more than 22% of companies in the S&P 500 provided guidance for their Q3 earnings results that are expected to beat analysts' expectations, the highest in a year. However, Q3 profits are expected to have risen by +7.2%, the smallest increase in two years. Also, Q3 sales growth is projected to slow to +5.9% from 6.4% in Q2. The markets are pricing in a 97% chance of a -25 bp rate cut at the next FOMC meeting on Oct 28-29. Overseas stock markets on Friday settled lower. The Euro Stoxx 50 closed down -1.68%. China's Shanghai Composite closed down -0.94%. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -1.01%. Interest Rates December 10-year T-notes (ZNZ5) on Friday closed up by +21 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield fell -8.3 bp to 4.055%. Dec T-notes rallied to a 3-week high Friday, and the 10-yer T-note yield fell to a 3-week low of 4.042%. T-notes rallied on dovish comments today from Fed Governor Christopher Waller and St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem, who said they supported additional Fed rate cuts. Sliding inflation expectations are also bullish for T-notes, following the 10-year breakeven inflation rate's decline to a 2.25-month low of 2.316% on Friday. Gains in T-notes accelerated Friday after stocks sold off on threats from President Trump of ""massive increases"" in tariffs on Chinese goods. T-notes also have support amid concerns about the ongoing US government shutdown, which could lead to additional job losses, reduced consumer spending, and a weakened US economy, potentially allowing the Fed to continue cutting interest rates. European government bond yields on Friday moved lower. The 10-year German bund yield fell to a 3-week low of 2.633% and finished down -5.9 bp at 2.644%. The 10-year UK gilt yield fell to a 2-week low of 4.664% and finished down -7.1 bp to 4.675%. ECB Governing Council member and Bundesbank President Nagel said ""the bar is rather high"" to alter his assessment that the current ECB monetary policy stance is appropriate. ECB Governing Council member Kazaks said we are about neutral on ECB rates as inflation remains contained and the current 2% rate is appropriate. Swaps are discounting a 2% chance for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at its next policy meeting on October 30. US Stock Movers Chipmakers fell sharply on Friday, dragging the overall market lower. ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) closed down more than -9%, and Microchip Technology (MCHP) and ON Semiconductor (ON) closed down more than -8%. Also, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI), and Qualcomm (QCOM) closed down more than -7% and Lam Research (LRCX), KLA Corp (KLAC), and GlobalFoundries (GFS) closed down more than -6%. In addition, Analog Devices (ADI), Broadcom (AVGO), Micron Technology (MU), and Marvell Technology (MRVL) closed down more than -5%. Finally, ASML Holding NV (ASML) closed down more than -4%. The Magnificent Seven technology stocks sank on Friday, further weighing on the broader market. Tesla (TSLA) closed down more than -5% and Amazon.com (AMZN) closed down more than -4% to lead losers in the Dow Jones Industrials. Also, Nvidia (NVDA) closed down more than -4%, and Apple (AAPL) and Meta Platforms (META) closed down more than -3%. In addition, Microsoft (MSFT) closed down by more than -2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) closed down by more than -1%. Energy producers and energy service providers retreated on Friday after the price of WTI crude oil fell by more than 4% to a five-month low. As a result, APA Corp (APA) closed down by more than -7% and Halliburton (HAL) closed down more than -6%. Also, Baker Hughes (BKR), Devon Energy (DVN), and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) closed down more than -5%, and ConocoPhillips (COP) closed down more than -4%. In addition, Marathon Petroleum (MPC), Phillips 66 (PSX), and Diamondback Energy (FANG) closed down more than -3%. Venture Global (VG) closed down more than -24% as it potentially faces multibillion-dollar damages over disputed liquefied natural gas shipments, after an unexpected loss in a BP Plc arbitration that could pave the way for additional claims.

He's simply heeding his own advice to ""never invest in a business you cannot understand."" He doesn't know enough about most technologies to determine how marketable they are, or how well-defended they are from competition. And he's proven as much in his otherwise-impressive past. For instance, back in 2011, Buffett steered Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.70%) (BRK.B 0.78%) into a decent-sized stake in IBM (IBM 1.82%), which performed well enough shortly thereafter. We now know, however, that IBM just wasn't ready for the de-emphasis of personal computing workstations and the rise of cloud computing and mobility. By 2018, Berkshire had dumped its entire stake in the then-slumping stock. Lesson learned. To say the Oracle of Omaha has completely given up on technology stocks wouldn't be accurate, though. While it's likely he was encouraged by one or more of his lieutenants to do so, Buffett recently added more than a little bit of artificial intelligence (AI) technology exposure to Berkshire Hathaway's holdings. Here's a closer look at its two biggest AI positions. Warren Buffett isn't completely anti-technology There are several companies in Berkshire's portfolio tinkering with AI, for the record. Coca-Cola is one of them. Domino's Pizza is another. Both outfits are mostly just using AI to improve efficiency and curb costs, though, parsing mountains of digital minutiae that would otherwise be too overwhelming to manually handle. AI isn't exactly transforming their businesses or products, and as such, neither name is being counted as Buffett-owned AI stock. Apple (AAPL 2.04%), however, is a different story. It wasn't always an AI stock, either. Indeed, Apple was strangely late to the AI party. While the early versions of its voice-activated digital assistant Siri were powered by a kind of AI, they don't hold a candle to more powerful tools like Alphabet Google's Gemini or OpenAI's ChatGPT. The company didn't really get serious about AI until last year, when it announced in June that Apple Intelligence would launch later that year, turning iPhones into powerful productivity devices. Things didn't pan out nearly as well as hoped. Introduced in October to be optimized for the iPhone 16 that became available just a month prior, within a couple of months, even die-hard Apple fans were expressing disappointment. Not only were there only a handful of features, the few that were available at the time didn't offer iPhone owners enough reliably usable utility. By March of this year, the company replaced Siri's chief, and just a few weeks later, had regrouped its entire AI segment. For perspective, Apple now says the next new-and-improved version of Siri won't be ready for release until early next year, presumably in conjunction with several related updates of other Apple Intelligence features. The important detail of this initial misstep? Apple could have given up, turning its focus back on its non-AI hardware and functionality that's wowed consumers for well over a decade. It didn't, though. It doubled down, perhaps recognizing that consumer-friendly AI is a must-do, even if getting there's a complicated, painful journey. And perhaps that's as it should be. After all, research firm Market.us expects the worldwide intelligence virtual assistant market to grow at an average annual pace of 31% through 2034. Berkshire currently holds 280 million shares of Apple, collectively worth a little over $70 billion, by the way. That's only a fraction of the nearly 916 million shares it owned as of late 2023, but it's still the conglomerate's single-biggest stock position, at just under 24% of its total holdings. Buffett's other AI stock is Amazon (AMZN -0.61%), although it's a considerably smaller position. With only 10 million shares worth just a little over $2 billion, this trade makes up less than 1% of Berkshire Hathaway's total stock portfolio. Still, it's a trade Buffett's stuck with since early 2019, when he's had plenty of opportunity to lock in a nice profit. At first blush, Amazon admittedly doesn't look like much of an AI name. E-commerce remains its biggest business as measured by revenue, accounting for more than 80% of its total sales through the first half of this year. The other 20% comes from its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services. But this division is much more profitable than its e-commerce operation is. It's also growing much faster, sporting a year-over-year top-line improvement of 17% during the second quarter of this year, to continue a growth pace it's seen for years now. And it is increasingly an artificial intelligence business thanks to newer and better tech. For instance, Amazon has designed, built, and deployed its own AI processors that lower the net cost and improve the performance for cloud customers using their access to do artificial intelligence work. Specifically, its Graviton processors using Arm Holding chip architecture are 20% cheaper to use, because they're 60% more power-efficient than comparable alternatives. Netflix, Snap, and several other major companies now rely on Graviton silicon, along with a handful of other customers using Amazon Web Services as the backbone for their AI assistants. A bullish vote of confidence So does Berkshire's ownership of these AI-related names make both (or either) a buy for you? Not necessarily. If you were considering taking on a new position in either technology stock, the fact that Warren Buffett and his protégés remain bullish enough to stick with them this long speaks volumes; someone clearly sees enough defensible, sustainable upside, now and for the foreseeable future. Go ahead and take Buffett's lead on either, or both. Just don't own either one if you're specifically looking for an AI ""pure play"" stock. Neither of these names quite qualifies for that categorization. That's not a bad thing, though. See, while dedicated AI companies like Palantir Technologies and CoreWeave may be growing faster, a bunch of them are still in the red, and likely to remain unprofitable for a long time -- perhaps never actually achieving profitability. Profitable companies like Apple and Amazon that manage other profit centers and also have the ability to support the long-term growth of their artificial intelligence businesses -- by melding them with proven platforms -- are in a much better position to thrive in the long run."

Intel (INTC) shares are trading at their highest level in 18 months, with the latest gains sparked by a report the company is in early-stage talks to manufacture chips through its foundry business for rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Shares of the struggling chipmaker surged nearly 40% in September and have gained about 80% since the start of the year, boosted by news of a flurry of high-profile investments in the chipmaker—from the U.S. government, AI Favorite Nvidia (NVDA), and Japanese investment company SoftBank (SFTBY). Gains accelerated late last month after reports surfaced that that the chipmaker has solicited investments from Apple (AAPL) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM). The investments have renewed hopes that the once storied chipmaker will be able recapture market share under CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who assumed the role in March. Intel shares were down 0.4% at $35.80 in early trading Thursday, after gaining 7% yesterday following news of the possible deal with AMD. The stock, which is trading at its highest levels since April of last year, is up from a 2025 low of $17.67 set in April. Below, we take a closer look at Intel’s daily chart and apply technical analysis to identify major price levels worth watching out for. RSI Confirms Upward Price Momentum Since the 50-day moving average (MA) crossed above the 200-day MA in August to generate a bullish golden cross signal, Intel shares have continued to trend higher on above-average volume. Meanwhile, the relative strength index (RSI) confirms upward price momentum, though the indicator sits in overbought territory, which could potentially lead to near-term profit-taking. It’s also worth pointing out that the average directional index (ADX) recently crossed above 40, a reading that indicates strong trending conditions in the stock. Let’s identify two major overhead areas to watch if Intel shares continue gaining ground and also locate support levels worth tracking during potential downturns. Major Overhead Areas to Watch A continuation of the stock’s recent bullish momentum could see the price initially climb to around $42. The shares may run into overhead selling pressure in this location near the lower levels of a consolidation period that formed on the chart throughout most of February and March last year."

Wedbush recently raised its price target on AAPL stock to $310, citing “early strong demand signs” for the iPhone 17. Whether Apple reaches $310 in 2025 will likely depend on its ability to sustain consumer demand — especially for the ongoing iPhone cycle — surpass expectations in artificial intelligence (AI) execution, and navigate macroeconomic headwinds that could either support or drag back its growth trajectory.

Time to Buy ? ,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/microsoft-stock-keeps-beating-stock-market-buy/?source=iedfolrf0000001,www.fool.com,20250928T141500Z,semi,0.65,"When Satya Nadella succeeded Steve Ballmer as Microsoft's (MSFT 0.50%) CEO on Feb. 4, 2014, many investors dismissed the tech giant as a slow-growth stalwart with limited upside potential. But if you had invested $10,000 in Microsoft on Nadella's first day on the job, your investment would be worth $140,000 today and paying out nearly $1,000 in annual dividends. That same investment in an S&P 500 index fund would only be worth about $38,000 today. Let's see why Microsoft crushed the market -- and if it's still a good stock to buy. How did Microsoft become a growth stock again? Under Ballmer, Microsoft struggled to keep pace with Amazon (AMZN -0.61%), Alphabet's Google (GOOG 0.86%) (GOOGL 0.82%), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) in the mobile and cloud markets. Its Windows and Office products still relied on periodic desktop upgrades, and its Windows Phones couldn't keep up with iPhones and Androids. But after Nadella took over, Microsoft adopted an ambitious ""mobile first, cloud first"" strategy. It transformed its Office desktop software into cloud-based services, expanded its Azure cloud infrastructure platform, and integrated those upgrades into Windows. It also scrapped its Windows Phone program, launched iOS and Android versions of its top productivity apps, rolled out more Surface devices, and expanded its Xbox business with new products and bold acquisitions. Microsoft launched more AI services to process all the data that flowed through that sprawling ecosystem. It also started to accumulate a big stake in OpenAI -- the creator of ChatGPT and other generative AI applications -- in 2019. It then integrated OpenAI's tools into its Bing search engine, Azure's cloud platform, and its Copilot AI services. Microsoft's aggressive investments in the mobile, cloud, and AI markets initially squeezed its margins. But from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2025 (which ended this June), its revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12%, its gross margin expanded from 64.7% to 68.8%, and its earnings per share (EPS) increased at a CAGR of 5%. It maintained that momentum even as the pandemic, inflation, rising interest rates, and geopolitical conflicts rattled the global economy. Most of Microsoft's recent growth was driven by its cloud-based services. Azure is now the world's second-largest cloud infrastructure platform after Amazon Web Services (AWS), and its Office suite -- which was rebranded as Microsoft 365 in 2020 -- holds a near-duopoly in the productivity software market with Google Workspace. Why will Microsoft keep growing? From fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2028, analysts expect Microsoft's revenue and EPS to increase at CAGRs of 15% and 16%, respectively. That robust growth should be driven by the secular expansion of the cloud and AI markets. More companies should migrate their data to its public cloud, hybrid cloud, and edge deployments, while the expansion of its data centers should support the development of even more powerful AI applications across its ecosystem. Microsoft still faces intense competition from Amazon and Google in the cloud and AI markets, but it will likely draw in big companies that compete against those two tech giants in the e-commerce, streaming media, and digital advertising markets. Its Xbox gaming business, which absorbed Activision Blizzard and many other top game publishers, could also generate more recurring revenues with its Game Pass and Cloud Gaming services. The company also still held $94.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at the end of fiscal 2025. That gives it plenty of room to expand its business via more acquisitions or buy back more shares to boost its EPS. Is it the right time to buy Microsoft's stock? Microsoft's stock doesn't look cheap at 33 times this year's earnings, but the robust growth of its cloud and AI businesses might justify that higher valuation. Even if it trades at a more modest 30 times forward earnings and it merely matches analysts' expectations through fiscal 2028, its stock could still rise about 26% to $645 over the next two years. That return might not dazzle growth-oriented investors, but it would likely keep Microsoft's stock ahead of the S&P 500, which has generated an average annual return of 10% ever since its inception. Therefore, I think it's still a great stock for long-term investors to buy, hold, and forget."

Major U.S. equities indexes lost ground for a second consecutive session Wednesday, reflecting pressure on the tech sector and despite outperformance from energy names. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq lost around 0.3%, while the Dow ended 0.4% lower. Read here for Investopedia's comprehensive market coverage. Intel (INTC) stock jumped 6.4%, lifted by an afternoon report from Bloomberg that the company had discussed Apple (AAPL) buying a stake. The latest move higher for shares of the chipmaking giant also came after Micron Technology (MU) raised it outlook for PCs and traditional servers, two of Intel's key markets. Intel stock has gained more than 25% over the past month amid a string of high-profile investments from the U.S. government, SoftBank (SFTBY), and Nvidia (NVDA). Micron's stock fell nearly 3%, while Apple's was off less than 1%. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) shares tumbled 17%, more than any other stock in the S&P 500 on, after the mining giant lowered its forecasts for quarterly copper and gold sales. Issues at Freeport's Indonesia unit weighed on its outlook; .the company declared force majeure at its Grasberg mine after a mud flow partially blocked access to the underground facility, resulting in fatal injuries to two workers. Shares of Axon Enterprise (AXON) fell 10% after the provider of less-lethal weapons and other law enforcement technology announced the acquisition of Prepared, an emergency communications platform powered by artificial intelligence. Needham analysts reiterated their ""buy"" rating on Axon stock but noted the complexities involved in a potential return to the computer-aided dispatch market. Piper Sandler initiated coverage of Axon stock with a bullish ""overweight"" rating. Xcel Energy (XEL) said it agreed to settle litigation related to the devastating 2021 Marshall Fire in Colorado. Although the electric utility reaffirmed its belief that its equipment did not cause the fire, it will pay roughly $640 million to settle lawsuits involving more than 4,000 plaintiffs who sued for damages. Xcel Energy shares rose 6.7%, logging the benchmark index's top performance in the midweek trading session. Shares of health insurer Centene (CNC) gained 5.8%. Centene's managed health subsidiary Meridian Health of Illinois said it paid providers $15 million in value-based care incentives for improving health outcomes for its Medicaid members. Reductions in emergency room visits and inpatient readmissions under this initiative bode well for Centene's goal of reining in medical costs."

It's since been replaced by the broader S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.53%), and for tech-minded growth investors, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC 0.52%). For some investors, the 30 hand-picked stocks that make up the Dow make it too narrowly focused to serve as a barometer of the market's overall health. Nevertheless, some of the Dow Jones' constituents are underestimated and subsequently ready to outperform. Here's a closer look at three of them that are likely to do so sooner than later, and for a while. 1. Apple There's a reason Apple (AAPL 2.04%) shares started the year out on the wrong foot, tumbling from December's peak near $256 to April's low of $188. That's the company's failed foray into the artificial intelligence (AI) era. Although hopes were high when Apple Intelligence was officially launched in October of last year, it failed to impress. It didn't inspire a swell iPhone upgrades either. For all intents and purposes, Apple was forced back to the drawing board to rethink and rebuild its entire AI offering. There's also a reason, however, Apple shares have since reclaimed all the ground lost shortly after the company's disappointing entry into the artificial intelligence race. That is, consumers may not have been any more ready than Apple was to wade into AI waters, preferring to let the usual first-generation technology kinks get worked out. Now both sides of the table are ready. Nowhere is this idea more evident than in recent reports of firm demand for Apple's onboard-AI-capable iPhone 17. Although the company won't officially confirm it until releasing its quarterly numbers in late October, Bank of America, JPMorgan (JPM -0.24%), and Wedbush (along with several others) all agree that demand for the newest version of the popular smartphone is quite strong even without all of Apple's artificial intelligence improvements in place yet. The updated version of AI-powered digital assistant Siri, for instance, won't be available until spring of next year. And despite the company's slow start on this front, the long-term opportunity is still tremendous. Straits Research suggests the global generative artificial intelligence market that Apple Intelligence serves could be worth more than $200 billion by 2033, growing at an average annual pace of 32% between now and then to get there. Of course, consumers who utilize their iPhone for Apple's AI solutions will also fuel growth of the company's high-margin Services arm. 2. Johnson & Johnson As has been the case with most other pharmaceutical stocks, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 0.60%) shares have struggled since 2022. Although it was a win for everyone living on the planet, the taming of the COVID-19 pandemic has proven problematic for the drug business. Sales of J&J's COVID vaccine simply fell off a cliff, so to speak, but the contagion itself stymied the continued development of its pipeline. The stock's performance simply reflected this headwind. Like Apple shares though, there's a reason Johnson & Johnson stock has fought its way back from the multi-year low reached in early 2025 to test its 2022's highs. That is, many of the developmental efforts delayed by the pandemic are now back on track. And they're promising to be sure. In fact, J&J aims to be doing $50 billion in annual oncology drug sales alone by 2030. That's not seemingly huge compared to this year's expected total top line of more than $90 billion, some of which is already cancer-related revenue. It's coming, though. For perspective, that's more than three times the consensus estimate of the company's oncology revenue for 2028. Approvals of drugs like its bladder cancer treatment TAR-200 and the combination of Rybrevant and Lazcluze as a treatment for non-small cell lung cancer will push the company toward that goal, although they're still just the beginning. At one point, the company argued it would have at least 10 different drugs each generating more than $5 billion in yearly sales by that point, with another 15 drugs each producing at least $1 billion in annual revenue by then. J&J hasn't reaffirmed those specific numbers in 2025. The majority of the oncology drugs like Talvey and Tecvayli being touted at the time, though, are still in the company's developmental pipeline. Indeed, the company's got 18 cancer drug trials currently in phase 3 testing, plus another eight now in the FDA's hands for potential approval. And that's just cancer. All told, Johnson & Johnson has more than 100 drug trials underway. The point is, this iconic pharmaceutical company has been busier of late than given credit for by the market. 3. JPMorgan Chase Finally, add mega-bank JPMorgan Chase (JPM -0.24%) to your list of Dow stocks that could soar before the end of this year, and continue doing so well after. It's already doing so, in fact, rallying nearly 200% from its 2022 low to this month's record high. But since it's priced at only 16 times this year's expected per-share earnings of $19.44, there's room for more upside. And there's also reason to expect it. Despite the stock's steady forward progress over the course of the past three years, it hasn't exactly been a time of great growth for any aspect of the banking business. JPMorgan's expected top line of $180 billion for 2025 is only about 1% better than last year's sales, for perspective, while earnings are likely to fall just a bit from 2024's bottom line. Economic lethargy and an uncertain future are the key culprits. There's hope on the horizon, though. After being put on hold while waiting for more certainty, companies are finding they can't wait any longer to make acquisitions or complete mergers. That's why JPMorgan rival Goldman Sachs expects worldwide M&A volume to reach a record-breaking $3.9 trillion next year. It's already starting to take shape, in fact. As Goldman noted in its M&A outlook for the second half of 2025, ""We believe we're in the second year of a five-to-seven-year M&A market recovery. As corporates and sponsors work through and out of disruption, we expect key drivers to propel dealmaking through year-end."" A recent interest rate cut (and likely more to follow) of course will only fan these flames, now that it's become clearer that tariffs won't necessarily inflict as much damage on the global economy as initially feared. Mergers, acquisitions, public offers, and take-privates are a bigger business to Goldman Sachs than they are to JPMorgan Chase, which also operates a consumer-facing banking business. All the money industries are interrelated, though. So, what's directly good for JPMorgan's underwriting business is at least indirectly good for its other arms."

Stock indexes are lower after Monday's rally pushed the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrials, and the Nasdaq 100 to new record highs. At a speech in Rhode Island today, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell did not offer a clear indication of an October interest rate cut and warned that inflation from tariffs could persist. The weakness in the Magnificent Seven technology stocks today is a drag on the overall market. Strength in energy producers is a supportive factor for the overall market, with the price of WTI crude up more than +2%. Gold prices continue to soar, posting a new all-time high today, as dovish global central banks, geopolitical risks, and trade tensions have boosted demand for the metal as a store of value and a safe haven. Dovish Fed comments today knocked bond yields lower and are limiting losses in stocks, with the 10-year T-note yield down -1 bp to 4.13% The US Q2 current account balance was -$251.3 billion, a smaller deficit than expectations of -$256.6 billion. The US Sep S&P manufacturing PMI fell -1.0 to 52.0, weaker than expectations of 52.2. The US Sep Richmond Fed manufacturing sentiment survey unexpectedly fell -10 to -17, versus expectations of an increase to -5. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said the Fed is mildly restrictive and the neutral policy rate is 100-125 basis points below the current rate. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said, ""Now that we have seen many months of deteriorating labor market conditions, it is time for the FOMC to act decisively and proactively to address decreasing labor market dynamism and emerging signs of fragility."" Rising corporate earnings expectations are a bullish backdrop for stocks. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, more than 22% of companies in the S&P 500 provided guidance for their Q3 earnings results that are expected to beat analysts' expectations, the highest in a year. Also, S&P companies are expected to post +6.9% earnings growth in Q3, up from +6.7% as of the end of May. The markets this week will focus on any fresh trade or tariff news. Later today, Fed Chair Powell speaks on the economic outlook at an event at the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce.

Finally, the University of Michigan's Sep US consumer sentiment index is expected to remain unchanged at 55.4. The markets are pricing in a 91% chance of a -25 bp rate cut at the next FOMC meeting on Oct 28-29. Overseas stock markets today are mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 is up +0.70%. China's Shanghai Composite fell to a 2-week low and closed down -0.18%. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 did not trade as markets in Japan are closed today for the Autumnal Equinox Day holiday. Interest Rates December 10-year T-notes (ZNZ5) today are up by +2 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield is down by -1.0 bp to 4.137%. T-note prices are slightly higher today on dovish comments from Fed Governor Michelle Bowman, who said policymakers are in danger of falling behind the curve and need to act decisively to cut interest rates as the labor market weakens. Additionally, short-covering ahead of a speech later today by Fed Chair Powell is driving up T-notes. Gains in T-notes are limited due to supply pressures, as the Treasury will auction $211 billion of T-notes and floating-rate notes this week, beginning with today's $69 billion auction of 2-year T-notes. European government bond yields today are moving lower. The 10-year German bund yield is down by -0.1 bp at 2.748%. The 10-year UK gilt yield is down -2.2 bp at 4.690%. The Eurozone Sep S&P manufacturing PMI fell -1.2 to 49.5, weaker than expectations of no change at 50.7.

Swaps are discounting a 1% chance for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at its next policy meeting on October 30.

The price of gold rose more than +1% Monday to a new all-time high as dovish global central banks, geopolitical risks, and trade tensions have boosted demand for the metal as a store of value and as a safe-haven.

T-note came under pressure Monday on hawkish comments from St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, and Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, who said they see limited room for additional Fed interest rate cuts. Monday's rally in the S&P 500 to a new record high has also curbed safe-haven demand for T-notes.

December E-mini S&P futures (ESZ25) are up +0.16%, and December E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQZ25) are up +0.23%. Stock indexes shook off early losses today and are moving higher, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 posting new record highs on strength in semiconductor and AI-infrastructure stocks. Gains in stocks are limited due to higher bond yields as hawkish Fed commentary pushed the 10-year T-note yield to a 2-week high of 4.145%. Stock indexes are holding near record highs as they consolidate last week’s rally that pushed the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrials, and the Nasdaq 100 to new record highs. Stocks rallied last week on the view that a weakened US labor market with contained inflation will allow the Fed to keep cutting interest rates. The price of gold is up more than +1% today at a new all-time high as dovish global central banks, geopolitical risks, and trade tensions have boosted demand for the metal as a store of value and as a safe-haven. Today’s minor US economic news was supportive of stocks after the Aug Chicago Fed national activity index rose +0.16 to a 5-month high of -0.12, stronger than expectations of -0.15. Fed comments today were on the hawkish side and negative for stocks. St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem said he sees limited room for additional Fed interest rate cuts amid elevated inflation and believes rates are now “between modestly restrictive and neutral.” Also, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said he sees “little reason” for the Fed to cut interest rates further as he is concerned about elevated inflation and does not see inflation returning to 2% until 2028. The price of Bitcoin (^BTCUSD) today is down by more than -2% at a 1.5-week low, driven by long liquidation pressures. According to data from Coinglass, more than 407,000 traders liquidated positions over the past twenty-four hours. Rising corporate earnings expectations are a bullish backdrop for stocks. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, more than 22% of companies in the S&P 500 provided guidance for their Q3 earnings results that are expected to beat analysts’ expectations, the highest in a year. Also, S&P companies are expected to post +6.9% earnings growth in Q3, up from +6.7% as of the end of May. The markets this week will focus on any fresh trade or tariff news. On Tuesday, the Sep S&P manufacturing PMI is expected to fall -1.1 to 51.9. Also, Fed Chair Powell speaks on the economic outlook at an event at the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce. On Wednesday, Aug new home sales are expected to decline by -0.3% m/m to 650,000. On Thursday, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to increase by +3,000 to 234,000. Also, Aug core (ex-defense and aircraft) capital goods new orders are expected to slip -0.1% m/m. In addition, Q2 GDP is expected to be unrevised at +3.3% (q/q annualized).

The markets are pricing in a 91% chance of a -25 bp rate cut at the next FOMC meeting on Oct 28-29. Overseas stock markets today are mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 is down by -0.37%. China’s Shanghai Composite closed up +0.22%. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +0.99%. Interest Rates December 10-year T-notes (ZNZ5) today are down by -2 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield is up by +0.8 bp to 4.135%. T-note prices today gave up an early advance and turned lower on hawkish comments from St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, who said they see limited room for additional Fed interest rate cuts. Today’s rally in the S&P 500 to a new record high has also curbed safe-haven demand for T-notes. Supply pressures are bearish for T-notes as the Treasury will auction $211 billion of T-notes and floating rate notes this week, beginning with Tuesday’s $69 billion auction of 2-year T-notes. European government bond yields today are lower. The 10-year German bund yield fell from a 2.5-week high of 2.762% and is down -0.3 bp at 2.745%. The 10-year UK gilt yield fell from a 2-week high of 4.724% and is down -1.5 bp at 4.700%. Swaps are discounting a 2% chance for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at its next policy meeting on October 30.

The firm has a $290 price target on the stock. According to the firm, Apple is “the gateway to the Intelligence Revolution,” and it is well positioned to benefit from artificial intelligence advancements. It noted how the recent Google remedies decision have eliminated an overhang for Apple and also paved way for the company to leverage Gemini’s AI technology. “We are positive on Apple to continue to drive strong EPS growth from its expansion of its user base and share buybacks but note significant risks ahead, notably in AI and in new devices. That said, one of the key risks – the Google DOJ remedies – has reached a resolution favorable to Apple, eliminating an overhang and potentially clearing a path for partnerships in AI.” Apple is a technology company known for its consumer electronics, software, and services.

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock is posting significant gains in Friday's trading. The company's share price was up 3.3% as of 3 p.m. ET. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) was up 0.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) was up 0.4%. In addition to positive momentum for the broader market today, especially tech stocks, Apple is getting a lift from a potentially bullish demand indicator for its iPhone lines. According to a recent report from The Information, the tech giant has instructed its manufacturing suppliers to increase production of its base-level iPhone 17 mode. Apple stock rises on iPhone 17 news According to the recent report, Apple has increased its orders for entry-level iPhone 17 models. The basic iPhone 17 models retails at a price of $799. Meanwhile, the iPhone 17 Pro model sells at $1,099. News that Apple is moving to increase production for one of the models in its iPhone 17 line is generally encouraging, but there could be some complicating factors. What's next for Apple? Increased production output for Apple's entry-level iPhone 17 model seems like a positive demand indicator, but it also comes with some margin concerns. While a rise in production output for the base-level iPhone 17 suggests that the model is doing better than expected, it also raises questions about whether other iPhone 17 products may be underperforming. If so, it could reflect general consumer hesitance when it comes to the latest iPhones that winds up actually being a net negative for Apple. Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?

The bulk of that spending is going toward semiconductors. That includes server racks full of graphics processing units (GPUs) and custom AI accelerators and networking equipment with the most cutting-edge networking chips inside. And demand for AI-related silicon may continue to grow for the foreseeable future. McKinsey estimates global spend on AI chips and computing hardware for data centers will surpass $3 trillion in 2030. The near term is just as bright. And one of the leading semiconductor stocks just shared some news that suggests it could produce another blowout quarter, surpassing its own sales guidance and analysts' expectations. TSMC: The semiconductor titan behind the AI boom There's a lot of debate about the future of AI, how the biggest companies will train their models, and what chips they'll use for inference. Behind all of that stands a single company poised to benefit no matter who wins the next big contract for AI development. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -1.49%), known as TSMC, is the largest semiconductor foundry in the world. It commands over 70% of all chip manufacturing spending thanks to its leading-edge process technology and advanced packaging capabilities. It takes contract work from all over the world and with the biggest companies like Nvidia (NVDA 0.86%) and Apple (AAPL 2.04%). The Taiwanese company releases sales data every month, and it recently updated investors with its August sales report. The data show the company is well ahead of pace toward its guidance of 939.6 billion New Taiwan dollars in sales this quarter. For the first two months of the period, it's already produced sales of NT$658.9 billion ($21.85 billion). Historically, July and August sales account for about 65% of third-quarter sales, but they already surpass 70% of TSMC's revenue guidance. There are a few things that could be leading to the strong performance. Tariff concerns could have pulled in some orders from September to July and August. The Trump administration has threatened tariffs on semiconductors, but TSMC appears to have appeased the U.S. government with its pledge to build out more facilities in Arizona. It's currently exempt from the 100% tariff on semiconductor imports. On the other hand, TSMC could have benefited from stronger-than-expected demand continuing to push sales of its leading-edge node. Nvidia resumed production of its H20 units designed for the Chinese market, but it stopped again as the Chinese government urged local companies not to buy them. Still, other AI chipmakers using TSMC's foundry have shown strong growth in demand for their chips. Meanwhile, Apple started ramping up production of new chips for its iPhone 17 launch. Overall, investors should expect September sales to look more similar to its July and August sales average rather than a steep drop. As a result, third-quarter sales results should surpass current analyst expectations. The long-term growth engine for TSMC TSMC is well-positioned to maintain its dominant position as AI chip spending soars over the next half-decade. Management expects to grow revenue at a compound annual rate of 20% per year from 2024 through 2029, but even that number may be underestimating its potential. TSMC is the top manufacturer for chipmakers that want the most cutting-edge chips, and its technology lead could grow wider over the coming years. That's because it already dominates the industry with over 70% of total spending on chip fabrication. That gives it a ton of capital to plow into research and development, to push forward its leading-edge node technology and its advanced packaging capabilities. In turn, its next-generation technology drives future demand and provides practically no alternative for those seeking the best technology. The strength of TSMC's technology lead is seen in its reported pricing for its next-generation 2nm process. It's reportedly charging $30,000 per wafer, up 50% from its 3nm process. That could be followed by another 50% increase in wafer pricing for its forthcoming 1.6nm process. TSMC is also reportedly raising the price on its older technology by 5% to 10% in 2026. Those significant price increases should enable TSMC to not only grow its revenue quickly over the next few years, but also be able to maintain its high gross margin profile even as it ramps up its newest technology. That should support very strong earnings growth for the business and its investors. Despite that potential, the stock currently trades for 26.6 times forward earnings expectations. And if TSMC can continue to outperform those earnings expectations, as its most recent financial update suggests, that could prove an absolute bargain of a price for investors right now."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) without disclosing any price target. The rating comes after the company announced its iPhone 17 series. The analyst noted that his bullish sentiment is based on the strong demand signals for the new iPhone 17 series. He highlighted that the initial delivery lead times for the new series are longer than the previous one, indicating higher consumer interest. Moreover, this improved consumer sentiment is seen across all key regions, including the US, Europe, and China.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is reportedly considering the possibility of test-producing foldable iPhones in Taiwan. Apple has been in discussions with its suppliers regarding the potential establishment of a test production line for foldable iPhones in Taiwan, Nikkei Asia reported on Thursday. The company plans to manufacture approximately 95 million iPhones for its 2026 lineup, marking the highest production in years and a more than 10% increase over 2025. Trending: The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share. Apple's proposed plan would also enable it to accelerate the shift of its new product development away from China amid ongoing Beijing–Washington tensions. The company aims to utilize the engineering capabilities and ecosystem of its Taiwanese suppliers to establish a small pilot line, testing equipment and fine-tuning the manufacturing process for its foldable iPhone, according to the report. After completing these steps, the process will be replicated in India for large-scale production. This strategy is expected to accelerate Apple's learning curve and facilitate a seamless production rollout in the country, the report said. Apple may set up a pilot production line for a foldable iPhone in northern Taiwan, though plans are still tentative. The company expects the foldable model to drive demand for all iPhone models. See Also: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? Apple’s potential Taiwan-India production strategy is viewed as a means to mitigate risks and logistical hurdles arising from tensions between the U.S. and China, as well as between China and India. This move also aligns with Apple’s recent announcement of a record $600 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing. This investment is expected to benefit 79 factories nationwide and spark a “domino effect” of growth, as CEO Tim Cook believes Analysts are also bullish on Apple’s future, with some predicting that the stock could rally by more than 28%. Meanwhile, the demand for Apple’s latest iPhone 17 series is reportedly tracking modestly ahead of the iPhone 16. The new smartphone is outperforming its predecessor, according to JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee.

All about the AI The analyst behind the move was Bernstein SocGen Group's Mark Newman, who launched his Apple tracking with a recommendation of outperform (buy, in other words). The pundit set his price target at $290, anticipating upside of 22% on the high-profile tech stock's most recent closing stock price. According to reports, Newman was most encouraged by Apple being something of a quick pathway to artificial intelligence (AI) takeup for users. The company's latest iPhone models, for example, are packed with easy-to-use and device-native AI technology. The Bernstein analyst wrote that this provided quicker access to AI functionalities. On the flip side, Newman cautioned that Apple could suffer if AI integration and implementation are not managed effectively. Customers could defect to other device makers. The fruits of successful integration That's a somewhat offbeat take on Apple. Of course, like any large tech company, it's trying hard to wed AI functionalities to its hardware and software, but for the most part it isn't renowned as an AI company. But this technology is pivotal for future success. As Newman wrote, Apple will need to integrate it well."

Its dominant consumer tech brand has been a market leader for nearly two decades, but there hasn't been a ton of growth in this sector recently. This has led to slow growth from Apple alongside an expensive stock price. There are far more attractive investment options available, and I believe there are three stocks that can surpass Apple's market cap by 2030. This trio is made up of Alphabet (GOOG 0.86%) (GOOGL 0.82%), Amazon (AMZN -0.61%), and Broadcom (AVGO -1.24%). All three are worthy investments, and I think they can easily outperform Apple and the rest of the market along the way. This trio has AI upside that Apple does not To say that Apple has stumbled in its artificial intelligence (AI) rollout is an understatement. Apple is far behind its competitors in this sector, and it may lose some smartphone market share if it doesn't quickly correct its course. While there hasn't been a defining AI feature that separates Apple from others quite yet, it may be on the horizon and could cause significant headwinds for Apple. This trio is openly embracing the AI arms race, unlike Apple. Alphabet is the parent company of Google, which has already evolved its search engine to include AI search overviews: integrated generative AI alongside a traditional search experience. It also has a leading generative AI model Gemini, which continues to perform quite favorably compared to other generative AI models that outperformed it at the start of the AI arms race. Alphabet is also profiting from massive AI build-out thanks to its cloud computing division, Google Cloud. Alphabet is renting its computing capacity out to many AI companies, including OpenAI and Meta Platforms, causing impressive growth for this division. Amazon is in a similar boat to Alphabet, as its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is also experiencing massive demand for AI. AWS is a significant part of Amazon's business, accounting for 53% of total operating profits despite comprising just 18% of total sales. AWS grew revenue 17% year over year in Q2, and while that's not nearly as fast as Google Cloud's 32%, AWS is also a much larger business, so achieving rapid growth rates is challenging. Still, there are significant tailwinds blowing in favor of cloud computing, and Amazon is well positioned to benefit. Lastly is Broadcom, which has a long way to go to overcome Apple's head start. Its $1.7 trillion market cap is about half of Apple's, but it has the biggest growth tailwind of these businesses. Broadcom is heavily involved in the computing side of the AI arms race, manufacturing networking switches (which are necessary to stitch together information across multiprocessor devices) and custom AI chips. Broadcom is working with end users (like Alphabet's Google Cloud) to design purpose-built computing hardware. This eliminates the middleman and enables them to tailor the chips to specific workloads, rather than relying on a broad computing device like a GPU. Broadcom's revenue is rapidly accelerating, and it could easily overtake Apple over the next few years. What is required to overtake Apple? Each company has a different way to overtake Apple's valuation. For Alphabet, it's simple: Be on a level playing field. Alphabet generates more net income than Apple does already, so if these two had the exact same valuation, Alphabet would already be worth more. Considering Alphabet is growing faster and Apple appears to be overvalued, I wouldn't be surprised to see Alphabet pass Apple much quicker than just five years. Amazon needs to continue growing its profits rapidly, which it's doing thanks to outsized growth from its high-margin divisions (like AWS and advertising services). If Amazon can maintain its impressive operating profit growth rate, it will likely surpass the point where it generates greater profits than Apple. Lastly, Broadcom has a steep uphill climb to surpass Apple, but its rapidly growing AI division could do that. In Q3 FY 2025 (ended Aug. 3), Broadcom's AI-related revenue increased 63% year over year to $5.2 billion. That's about a third of Broadcom's total revenue, but if it maintains that growth trajectory, Broadcom can easily outgrow Apple over the next five years to become a larger business. I think all three stocks can be worth more than Apple by 2030, and each will be a strong investment along the way."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the AI Stocks In The Spotlight For Investors. On September 10, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives reiterated an Outperform rating on the stock with a $270.00 price target. The firm believes that significant upgrade opportunities are ahead of the tech giant following Apple Event 2025. The firm said that an identified approximately 315 million iPhone users out of Apple’s global user base of 1.5 billion have not upgraded their devices in over four years. This, it believes, represents a substantial potential for future sales growth. “The Spark for a New Era at Apple. We estimate roughly 315 million iPhone users of 1.5 billion users worldwide have not upgraded their phones in over 4 years speaking to an upgrade opportunity on the horizon for Cupertino with China front and center. The company’s focus on much-improved internal product efficiencies balanced with bold redesigns and practical new features interwoven with Apple Intelligence sets Apple up to launch towards an eventual super cycle over the next 12 to 18 months while the company looks to improve its AI strategy that’s holding the stock back.” Apple is a technology company known for its consumer electronics, software, and services.

These two companies are currently the third and fourth largest in the world by market cap, so neither is likely to provide market-crushing returns. As a result, investors need to determine if either of them can outperform the market over the long term; otherwise, they aren't worth owning. I believe there is a clear better buy between the two right now, and this stock could easily outperform the market over the next five years, while the other may struggle to do so. Which one is it? The answer may surprise you. Both businesses want to maintain the status quo Both Apple and Alphabet have some of the most recognizable brands on the planet. Apple's ecosystem is centered around the iPhone, with accessories and laptops to create a leading consumer technology brand. Alphabet is the parent company of many businesses, but its most notable brand is Google. Google is how the vast majority of people access the right content on the internet, although that notion is under distress. Many investors believe that generative AI could replace Google, although that remains to be seen. Google remains the top search engine used by many, and with its recent integration of AI search overviews, it has also evolved to adapt to this AI-centric view. Additionally, Alphabet recently won a court case that allowed it to stay in its current state and continue paying Apple for the right to be the default search engine on its iPhones. This helps ensure Alphabet's status quo is maintained, and is an extremely positive sign for investors. Apple is thriving on the status quo, as it hasn't really released a new feature or technology in recent years. That may change at its next release event, but investors will need to see what the market demand is for anything that Apple releases, as it could be a flop. At their core, Alphabet and Apple are two businesses that want to maintain the status quo while expanding when possible. This doesn't really distinguish either of them from the other, so we'll need to examine their finances to determine the true best buy. Winner: Tie Alphabet is putting up better growth figures Since 2023, Apple's growth has been practically nonexistent. That changed in Q3 FY2025 (ending June 28), when it delivered 10% revenue growth and 12% diluted earnings per share (EPS) growth. AAPL Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts Still, that pales in comparison to Alphabet's growth, which has been far stronger for much longer. In Q2, Alphabet's revenue rose by 14% and diluted EPS increased by 22%. That continues a long-standing streak of Alphabet outperforming Apple from this standpoint, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that pattern continue. Alphabet's faster growth stems from some of its other divisions, such as Google Cloud and Waymo. Both of these have massive upside and provide growth wings that Apple can't match. As a result, I think it's fairly clear that Alphabet has far better growth than Apple. Winner: Alphabet Alphabet's stock is far cheaper Valuation is another important consideration, as it's possible that the slower-growing company can be the better investment if it's priced cheap enough. However, that's not the case here. Apple's stock is significantly more expensive than Alphabet's, despite the latter's much slower growth. Although they used to trade at a similar price-to-earnings (P/E) price tag, a significant gap has opened up since mid-2024. However, after reviewing the growth charts from above, it's clear that Alphabet has grown much faster than Apple during this time frame. As a result, Apple's stock has become far more expensive than it normally is, while Alphabet is just returning to its usual valuation range. This makes Alphabet a far better buy considering its growth. Winner: Alphabet"

September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) are up +0.44%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) are up +0.42%. Stock indexes are mostly higher today, with the S&P 500 posting a new record high and the Nasdaq 100 posting a 4-week high. Stocks are rallying today as bond yields fell after US producer prices for August unexpectedly eased, cementing expectations for Fed interest rate cuts. The 10-year T-note yield is down -3 bp to 4.06%. Stocks also have support from a +42% surge in Oracle to a record high, leading technology stocks higher after it gave an aggressive outlook for its cloud business, driven by demand for AI infrastructure. The Dow Jones Industrials are being pressured today by weakness in Apple, which is down more than -2% on market disappointment in the launch of the latest versions of the iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods. Also, the escalation of geopolitical tensions in Europe is negative for stocks after Poland shot down drones that crossed into its territory during Russia’s latest air strike on Ukraine, calling it an “act of aggression.” Signs of ongoing deflation in China are negative for China’s economy and global growth prospects. China’s Aug CPI fell -0.4% y/y, weaker than expectations of -0.2% y/y and the steepest decline in 6 months. Also, China’s Aug PPI fell -2.9% y/y, right on expectations, and the thirty-fifth consecutive month that producer prices have declined on a year-on-year basis. US MBA mortgage applications rose +9.2% in the week ended September 5, with the purchase mortgage sub-index up +6.6% and the refinancing sub-index up +12.2%. The average 30-year fixed rate mortgage fell -15 bp to an 11-month low of 6.49% from 6.64% in the prior week. The US Aug final-demand PPI eased to +2.6% y/y from +3.1% y/y in July, a smaller increase than expectations of +3.3% y/y. Aug PPI ex-food and energy eased to +2.8% y/y from +3.4% y/y in July, a smaller increase than expectations of +3.5% y/y. Market focus this week will be on any trade or tariff news. On Thursday, the US Aug CPI is expected to climb to +2.9% y/y from +2.7% y/y in July, and Aug CPI ex-food and energy is expected to increase +3.1% y/y, unchanged from July’s +3.1%. Also, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to fall by -2,000 to 235,000. On Friday, the University of Michigan’s Sep US consumer sentiment index is expected to slip -0.2 to 58.0. The markets are now pricing in a 100% chance of a -25 bp rate cut and a 12% chance of a -50 bp rate cut at the upcoming FOMC meeting on Sep 16-17. After the fully expected -25 bp rate cut at the Sep 16-17 meeting, the markets are discounting a 79% chance of a second -25 bp rate cut at the Oct 28-29 meeting. The markets are now pricing in an overall -74 bp rate cut in the federal funds rate by year-end to 3.64% from the current 4.38% rate. Overseas stock markets today are mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 fell from a 1.5-week high and is down -0.17%. China’s Shanghai Composite closed up +0.13%. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +0.87%. Interest Rates December 10-year T-notes (ZNZ5) today are up by +4 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield is down by -3.1 bp to 4.057%. T-notes erased early losses and moved higher today after US Aug producer prices eased more than expected, a dovish factor for Fed policy and cementing expectations for at least a 25 bp rate cut at next week’s FOMC meeting. Strength in stocks today is limiting gains in T-note prices. Also, supply pressures are weighing on T-notes as the Treasury will auction $39 billion of 10-year T-notes later today as part of this week’s $119 billion slate of T-note and T-bond auctions. Concerns about Fed independence are negatively impacting T-note prices due to President Trump’s attempt to fire Fed Governor Cook and Stephen Miran’s intention to hold a Fed Governor position while remaining technically in his White House role on the Council of Economic Advisors. European government bond yields today are mixed. The 10-year German bund yield fell to a 1-month low of 2.631% and is down -0.5 bp to 2.654%. The 10-year UK gilt yield is up +1.2 bp to 4.636%. Swaps are discounting no chance for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at Thursday’s policy meeting. US Stock Movers Oracle (ORCL) is up more than +42% to lead gainers in the S&P 500 after giving a robust forecast for its cloud-infrastructure business, a sign of strong AI-related demand. After fiscal year 2026, the company sees cloud infrastructure revenue in the subsequent four years of $32 billion, $73 billion, $114 billion, and $114 billion. Stocks tied to AI computing infrastructure are rallying after Oracle forecasted faster-than-expected revenue growth in its cloud infrastructure unit.

Also, Arista Networks (ANET) is up more than +5%, and Nvidia (NVDA) is up more than +4% to lead gainers in the Dow Jones industrials. In addition, Super Micro Computer (SMCI) is up more than +4% and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is up more than +3%. Today’s rally in AI-infrastructure stocks is also boosting power-producing stocks, as the increase in AI usage will require more power. Vertiv Holdings (VRT) is up more than +11%, and Vistra Corp (VST) is up more than +6%. Also, Constellation Energy (CEG) and GE Vernova (GEV) are up more than +5%, and Talen Energy (TLN) is up more than +4%.

Chewy (CHWY) is down more than -15% despite reporting better-than-expected Q2 results, with analysts citing disappointment that the results weren’t even better. Humana (HUM) is down more than -2%, adding to Tuesday’s -12% plunge, after a post on LinkedIn, cited by analysts at Leerink Partners, stated that changes in the thresholds for Medicare quality ratings that pay bonuses to health plans are harder to get. Humana receives most of its revenue from selling private Medicare Advantage plans. Other health insurers are also under pressure, with HCA Healthcare (HCA), Molina Healthcare (MOH), and Elevance Health (ELV) down more than -3%, and Centene (CNC) down more than -2%. Trade Desk Inc (TTD) is down more than -7% after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to equal weight from overweight.

c244ce1b40c07032042940beb6d6fa93b14c37509bd1ce167db3ed9aaa23d9aa,AAPL,Why Analysts Call Broadcom a  Magnificent Eight  Stock That Can Challenge Nvidia,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-analysts-call-broadcom-magnificent-205733538.html,finance.yahoo.com,20250910T091500Z,semi,0.65,"Strong quarterly results from Broadcom could signal strong competition for AI heavyweight Nvidia. Broadcom (AVGO) last week reported record quarterly sales that showed strong demand for its AI offerings and introduced a big new mystery customer reports suggested could be ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Citi analysts said the results and growing commitments from buyers—many which are also Nvidia (NVDA) customers—could suggest an estimated $12 billion hit to Nvidia’s 2026 sales. Citi analysts on Monday maintained a “buy” rating on Nvidia stock but trimmed their target price to $200 from $210, citing concerns about threats to Nvidia's dominance after Broadcom (AVGO) said last week it expects demand from major Big Tech clients to shift in favor of its custom AI chips, potentially setting it up to win more market share. Broadcom’s stock climbed more than 3% to close Monday around $346, adding to a nearly 10% jump Friday after its better-than-expected earnings. Nvidia shares ticked less than 1% higher to end today around $168 after taking a 3% hit in Friday’s session. (Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here.) “People freaked out a bit after Broadcom earnings,” Melius Research analysts led by Ben Reitzes told clients Monday. They see Broadcom as a “Magnificent 8” stock—worthy of joining the group of seven tech heavyweights—with significant room to rise. “To be clear, we have always taken a view that Nvidia's share of AI compute would actually fall over time as chip designers like Broadcom would gain about 30% of share and a gang of other merchants led by AMD would take at least 10%,” they said. Melius Says Broadcom, Nvidia Can Go 'A Heck of a Lot Higher' Melius analysts, who reiterated ""buy"" ratings and bullish targets of $240 for Nvidia and $415 for Broadcom, said they believe both chipmakers are likely to be winners of the rapidly growing AI computing and networking market. Nvidia's potential to build an Apple-like (AAPL) ""ecosystem"" with developers loyal to its programmable architecture may also be underestimated, they suggested, drawing parallels to the iPhone maker's ability to sustain long-term gains even as its share of the market for smartphones declined. If Broadcom were able to capture even 20% of an estimated $2 trillion addressable market for 2030 while Nvidia holds onto a 40% share—down from over 70% currently—both stocks ""are going a heck of a lot higher,"" Melius said. They see both stocks more than doubling in value the next three years. Read the original article on Investopedia"

September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) are up +0.18%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) are up +0.68%. Stocks are climbing today on the prospect of a more accommodative Federal Reserve. The 10-year T-note yield fell to a 5-month low today of 4.05%. The markets have fully priced in a 25 bp rate cut by the Fed at next week's FOMC meeting and priced in a 10% chance for a 50 bp rate cut. However, this week's US Aug CPI and PPI reports will show how much room the Fed has to cut interest rates and support the job market. Stocks fell last Friday after the weaker-than-expected US Aug payroll report sparked concerns that the Fed was falling behind in supporting a rapidly cooling US labor market. Weaker-than-expected trade news from China is negative for global growth prospects after China's Aug exports rose +4.4% y/y, weaker than expectations of +5.5% y/y. Also, Aug imports rose +1.3% y/y, weaker than expectations of +3.4% y/y. Market focus this week will be on any trade or tariff news. On Tuesday, the BLS will release annual benchmark revisions to US payrolls in the year through March. On Wednesday, Aug PPI final demand is expected to climb +3.3% y/y, unchanged from July, and Aug PPI ex-food and energy is expected to ease to +3.5% y/y from +3.7% y/y in July. On Thursday, Aug CPI is expected to climb to +2.9% y/y from +2.7% y/y in July, and Aug CPI ex-food and energy is expected to increase +3.1% y/y, unchanged from July. Also, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to fall by -3,000 to 234,000. On Friday, the University of Michigan Sep consumer sentiment index is expected to slip -0.2 to 58.0. The markets are now pricing in a 13% chance of a 50 bp rate cut at the upcoming FOMC meeting on Sep 16-17, versus the previous expectations of a zero chance of that 50 bp rate cut. After the fully expected -25 bp rate cut at the Sep 16-17 meeting, the markets are now discounting an 81% chance of a second -25 bp rate cut at the Oct 28-29 meeting, up from a 54% chance as of late Thursday. The markets are now pricing in an overall -76 bp rate cut in the federal funds rate by year-end to 3.62% from the current 4.38% rate. Regarding tariffs, a federal appeals court ruled late last month that President Trump exceeded his authority by imposing global tariffs without Congressional approval, but the court let the tariffs remain in place while appeals continue. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit Court said, ""The statute bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax."" The case now appears to be headed to the Supreme Court for a final decision. According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced. Overseas stock markets today are higher. The Euro Stoxx 50 is up +0.57%. China's Shanghai Composite closed up +0.38%. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 rose to a 2.5-week high and closed up +1.45%. Interest Rates December 10-year T-notes (ZNZ5) are up by +4 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield is down by -2.1 bp to 4.053%. The 10-year T-note yield dropped to a 5-month low today at 4.051% on carryover support from last Friday's weak US unemployment report that bolstered the outlook for Fed easing. Supply pressures are limiting gains in T-note prices as the Treasury will auction $119 billion of T-notes and T-bonds this week, beginning with Tuesday's $58 billion auction of 3-year T-notes. Concerns about Fed independence are negatively impacting T-note prices due to President Trump's attempt to fire Fed Governor Cook and Stephen Miran's intention to hold a Fed Governor position while remaining technically in his White House role on the Council of Economic Advisors. European government bond yields today are moving lower. The 10-year German bund yield fell to a 1-month low of 2.640% and is down -2.1 bp to 2.641%. The 10-year UK gilt yield dropped to a 3-week low of 4.616% and is down -2.9 bp to 4.615%. Swaps are discounting the chances at 1% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting. US Stock Movers The Magnificent Seven stocks are mostly higher today, lifting the broader market. Nvidia (NVDA) is up more than +2% and Meta Platforms (META) is up more than +2%.

In addition, KLA Corp (KLAC), ASML Holding NV (ASML), Marvell Technology (MRVL), ARM Holding NV (ARM), and Applied Materials (AMAT) are up more than +1%.

September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) are up +0.38%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) are up +0.87%. Stocks are trading higher on today’s weak US payroll report, which solidified market expectations for at least two Fed rate cuts by year-end. However, the unemployment report also suggested slower US economic growth, which would be negative for US corporate earnings. Today’s Aug payroll report of +22,000 was weaker than the consensus of +75,000. Over the past three months, payrolls have shown an average monthly rise of only +29,000. July payrolls were revised slightly higher to +79,000 from +73,000, but June was revised lower to a decline of -13,000. Aug private payrolls rose by only +38,000 while manufacturing payrolls fell by -12,000. The Aug unemployment rate rose by +0.1 point to a 3.75-year high of 4.3%, up from +4.2% in July, which was in line with market expectations. Aug average hourly earnings rose by +0.3% m/m, which was in line with market expectations. In a positive inflation development, the Aug average hourly earnings report eased to +3.7% y/y from +3.9% in July and was slightly weaker than expectations of +3.8%. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics released the unemployment report on time, but announced before the report that it was experiencing technical difficulties that might cause some data to be delayed. Stocks received support today as the 10-year T-note yield fell -8 bp on the US unemployment report. The markets are now pricing in a 17% chance of a 50 bp rate cut at the upcoming FOMC meeting on Sep 16-17, versus the previous expectations of a zero chance of that 50 bp rate cut. The markets are now discounting a 96% chance of a second -25 bp rate cut at the Oct 28-29 meeting, up from a 54% chance as of late Thursday. The markets are now pricing in an overall -75 bp rate cut in the federal funds rate by year-end to 3.63% from the current 4.38% rate. Regarding tariffs, a federal appeals court ruled late last Friday that President Trump exceeded his authority by imposing global tariffs without Congressional approval, but the court let the tariffs remain in place while appeals continue. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit Court said, “The statute bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax.” The case now appears to be headed to the Supreme Court for a final decision. According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced. Overseas stock markets today are higher. The Euro Stoxx 50 is up +0.23%. China’s Shanghai Composite closed up +1.24%, snapping a 3-session losing streak. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +1.03%. Interest Rates December 10-year T-notes (ZNZ5) are up +21 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield is down -8.5 bp at 4.076% and posted a 5-month low. T-note prices rallied on the weak US unemployment report and the increased chances for Fed easing. T-note prices are also seeing support from today’s -2.8 bp decline to 2.362% in the 10-year inflation expectations rate, driven by the weak unemployment report and today’s -2% decline in crude oil prices. T-note prices today are being driven by the weaker labor market and are ignoring, for the time being, concerns about Fed independence sparked by President Trump’s attempt to fire Fed Governor Cook and by Stephen Miran’s intention to be a Fed Governor while still technically holding his White House job on the Council of Economic Advisors. European government bond yields are lower. The 10-year German bund yield is down -5.3 bp to 2.666%. 10-year UK gilt yield is down -6.4 bp at 4.656%. Swaps are discounting the chances at 1% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting. US Stock Movers The Magnificent Seven stocks today are mixed, with four stocks trading higher but three trading lower. Tesla (TSLA) is leading the pack with a +3.7% gain after announcing a pay deal for Elon Musk potentially worth as much as $1 trillion to entice him to work at Tesla and meet aggressive targets. Apple (AAPL) is trading slightly higher after news that its annual fiscal sales in India hit a record of nearly $9 billion. Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) are down more than -1%. Crypto stocks are higher today due to Bitcoin’s (^BTCUSD) rally of +2.3% on the weak payroll report and increased expectations for Fed easing. Riot Platforms (RIOT) is up more than +3%, MARA Holdings (MARA) is up more than +2%, and Strategy (MSTR) is up more than +1%. Coinbase (COIN) is up +0.3%. Homebuilders climbed after the 10-year T-note yield fell to a 5-month low, a bullish factor for mortgage rates and housing demand. PulteGroup (PHM), Toll Brothers (TOL), Lennar (LEN), and DR Horton (DHI) are all up more than +2%. Broadcom (AVGO) is up more than +11% on an agreement with OpenAI to design and produce a new AI chip, seeking to displace Nvidia’s stronghold. Chip stocks are strong in general today, with gains of more than +2% in ASML (ASML), Micron (MU), and GlobalFoundries (GFS). Lululemon Athletica (LULU) is down more than -16% after reducing its guidance due to a weak consumer environment and tariffs.

The system, built on Qualcomm's Snapdragon Ride system-on-chips and a jointly developed AD software stack, is designed to support features ranging from NCAP-compliant safety functions to Level 2+ highway and urban navigation. Snapdragon Ride Pilot made its global debut Friday in the all-new BMW iX3, the first production vehicle in BMW’s Neue Klasse and has been validated for use in more than 60 countries with expected expansion to over 100 countries in 2026. Also Read: Why Qualcomm’s Stock Isn’t Soaring Like Its Rivals Qualcomm and BMW emphasized scalability and safety, describing Ride Pilot as a flexible platform built on 360-degree perception, context-aware driving, and compliance with the latest global safety standards. BMW has branded the technology the ""Superbrain of Automated Driving,"" citing computing power 20 times greater than its predecessor. The launch underscores Qualcomm's growing automotive ambitions. Automotive revenue hit a record $984 million in its fiscal third quarter, up 21% year-over-year, helping offset volatility in its core handset business. Total company revenue rose 10% to $10.37 billion, while adjusted earnings per share reached $2.77, marking the company's ninth consecutive earnings beat. Qualcomm CDMA Technologies revenue increased 11% to $8.99 billion, with handset sales climbing 7% and IoT revenue surging 24% to $1.68 billion. Looking ahead, Qualcomm guided fourth-quarter revenue between $10.3 billion and $11.1 billion and EPS of $2.75 to $2.95, in line with Wall Street expectations. Shares have gained 4% year-to-date, supported by strength in automotive and IoT, though muted guidance and handset headwinds have capped momentum. Analysts remain largely constructive. Rosenblatt's Kevin Cassidy described the quarter as a ""solid beat,"" noting the company's edge AI roadmap as a competitive advantage, though he trimmed fourth-quarter forecasts slightly. Bank of America's Tal Liani and J.P. Morgan's Samik Chatterjee reiterated bullish ratings, pointing to design wins in automotive, IoT expansion, and potential handset recovery. However, both flagged Qualcomm's significant exposure to China and the long-anticipated exit of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as ongoing risks. Price Action: Qualcomm stock is trading higher by 0.18% to $159.99 premarket at last check Friday. Read Next:"

The Justice Department had been gunning for Google – painting it as the monopolist of monopolists, with default search contracts, Chrome dominance, and Android power all stacking the deck against rivals. The specter of a forced breakup, or at least sweeping divestitures, loomed large. And then the judge said, eh. Yes, Google will have to stop signing exclusive default search deals (like the one it had with Apple) and is required to share some search data and indexing access with competitors. But the court stopped miles short of ordering any structural changes. Google gets to keep Chrome, Android, and its crown-jewel search business intact: no restructuring necessary. Wall Street’s verdict? Hallelujah. GOOGL shares ripped more than 8% higher in after-hours trading. But here’s the bigger story: this ruling isn’t just a “Google thing.” It’s a Big Tech thing. It sends a crystal-clear signal to markets and regulators alike – U.S. courts are reluctant to dismantle dominant technology firms in an era of rapid, AI-driven disruption. And that, my friends, is the buy signal we’ve been waiting for… Court Says AI Disruption Makes Google Breakup Excessive At the heart of Judge Amit Mehta’s ruling is an important acknowledgment: the technological landscape is changing too quickly to warrant radical remedies. With the rise of generative AI search rivals like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Perplexity, Anthropic’s Claude, and others, the idea that Google is an unassailable monopoly looks weaker by the day. In effect, the court is saying: why break up a company when the market itself is reshaping around it? This implies that regulators can bark, but they’ll find it harder to bite. Even if the DOJ or Federal Trade Commission files aggressive complaints against Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), or Microsoft (MSFT), the courts will likely favor behavioral tweaks over amputation or structural reconfiguration. And that precedent is exactly what Wall Street has been desperate to see. Why This Is Bullish for Google Let’s start with the obvious winner. Google just dodged a bullet. Its core advertising business – the search engine monopoly that prints hundreds of billions in revenue ($71.3 billion in the second quarter of 2025 alone) – remains intact. Its software ecosystem – Chrome, Android, Gmail, and YouTube – remains under one roof. And its competitive advantages – data scale, distribution, and user loyalty – remain untouched. Sure, losing exclusive search defaults with Apple stings. But many users re-select Google anyway. And as long as the brand is synonymous with search, Google’s share will stay sky-high. Meanwhile, the requirement to share some search data with rivals is annoying but hardly destructive. With Google’s lead in AI-driven search and YouTube’s video empire as a reinforcement mechanism, its moat is deep enough to absorb these blows. Yes, even in this new Age of AI, Google Search remains a juggernaut. According to AInvest: “Despite the growth in chatbot usage, Google continues to be the primary gateway to online news, information, and products. A study by Similarweb revealed that Americans visited news websites 9.5 billion times from using web search engines like Google, compared to 25 million times from ChatGPT between January and May 2025.” The resilience is just as strong for YouTube. In fact, in February of this year, “YouTube achieved its highest market share to date across TV screens in the United States, outperforming traditional TV distributors and even major streaming competitors like Netflix and Hulu,” as noted by Campaign Now. With the nightmare scenario – a forced divestiture – now dead, Google’s reign continues unchallenged. That’s why the stock took off. The Ruling Sets a Precedent for All Big Tech Defendants Here’s where it gets fun. The broader read-through is that the courts have Big Tech’s back. - Apple: Fears that its search deal with Google could become an antitrust liability are less worrisome now. Regulators might ban exclusivity, but Apple’s cash cow ecosystem isn’t going anywhere. - Amazon: The FTC may gripe about “self-preferencing” in its marketplace, but the idea that courts will order Amazon Web Services (AWS) spun off from retail? Unlikely. - Meta: Concerns that regulators could force divestitures of Instagram or WhatsApp just got weaker. Courts aren’t in the breakup business anymore. - Microsoft: Its investments in OpenAI and the bundling of Teams with Office 365 may face scrutiny, but the precedent here suggests any remedies will be tweaks, not extensive restructuring. This is the opposite of the 1990s Microsoft saga, when a court actually ordered a breakup before it was overturned on appeal. Today’s courts look more deferential to business models, more skeptical of sweeping remedies, and more attuned to the reality that AI is already disrupting the competitive landscape. In short: Big Tech’s existential risk premium just evaporated. AI Isn’t Just Growth for Big Tech – It’s Legal Armor, Too Here’s the kicker. AI isn’t just a growth driver for Big Tech – it’s now a defensive moat against regulators. Think about it. The very reason Judge Mehta rejected drastic remedies is that the AI revolution is already reshaping search competition. If new AI models can chip away at Google, why should the government break it apart? That logic applies across the board: - Amazon argues that AI-driven logistics competitors are emerging. - Meta points to AI-powered social rivals and creator platforms. - Microsoft cites the explosive proliferation of AI productivity tools. - Apple highlights the upcoming wave of AI-enhanced devices. In other words, the faster AI evolves, the harder it is for regulators to justify breakups. The future is too dynamic. Courts don’t want to play referee in a game where the rules keep changing. That’s why AI is not just an opportunity but a shield. It’s the perfect legal argument: we don’t need a breakup because the market will disrupt us anyway. Treat Big Tech Pullbacks as Buying Opportunities For investors, the lesson couldn’t be clearer. Big Tech is simultaneously the biggest growth story on the planet and the safest regulatory bet in decades. That’s a potent mix. - These companies are at the epicenter of the AI boom, raking in revenue from chips, cloud, ads, software, and devices. Their scale gives them the best data, the best models, and the best distribution. - The courts just telegraphed that breakup risk is minimal. Future cases will likely follow the Google template: no exclusivity, some data sharing, but no structural dismantling. Combine those two forces, and you get an asset class with outsized upside and limited downside. That’s why Wall Street piled into GOOGL after the ruling. And it’s why any weakness in the broader Big Tech complex should be seen as a buying opportunity. So, how do we act? - Own the Magnificent 7: Google, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla, and Nvidia. The antitrust clouds just parted, and the AI sun is shining. - Add on weakness: Whenever macro jitters knock these stocks down, treat it as a gift. The ruling proves their long-term moats are intact. - Double down on AI leaders: Nvidia (chips), Microsoft (enterprise AI), Google (search and ads), Meta (AI-driven engagement), and Amazon (AI-enhanced cloud) are the backbone of the AI revolution. - Stay patient: The compounding here is massive. These companies are printing cash, reinvesting in AI, and now face reduced regulatory risk. Long Live Big Tech: The AI Megatrend Shields Monopoly Risk The Justice Department framed this as the “most important antitrust trial in decades.” And yet, when the dust settled, Google walked away intact; stronger, even, because the market just realized that breakup risk is basically off the table. If Google, the poster child of alleged monopoly power, can dodge structural remedies, then Apple, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft are in the clear, too. Add the fact that AI is simultaneously fueling growth and acting as a shield against regulators, and you get one simple conclusion: Big Tech’s reign isn’t ending anytime soon. The AI megatrend is only accelerating, and every pullback in these names is proving to be a gift for investors who act fast. But here’s the catch: The real fortunes in every tech revolution have gone not to those who chased the giants… but to those who spotted the next wave of winners early. That’s exactly what my colleague, legendary investor Eric Fry, has spent his career doing – and now, he’s taken it a step further. After delivering more than 40 separate 1,000%-plus winners, Eric has built Apogee: a breakthrough AI-powered system designed to pinpoint the exact moment a stock is ready to skyrocket. In back testing, Apogee would’ve flagged Apple before its 4,331% surge… Nvidia before its 3,587% explosion… and Amazon before its 1,115% rally. Now, this same system has identified five brand-new stocks that have quietly entered the “10X Zone” – and Eric is revealing all five names for free. Join him next Wednesday, Sept. 10 at 10 a.m. Eastern to get the scoop on those five potential monster winners – and learn how Apogee can help you turn $1,000 into $10,000."

September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) are up +0.56%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) are up +1.00%. Stock indexes are mostly higher today, driven by lower T-note yields and increased chances of a Fed rate cut later this month. T-note yields fell after the July JOLTS job openings fell more than expected to a 10-month low. The 10-year T-note yield is down -5 bp to 4.22%. Strength in megacap technology stocks is also supporting gains in the broader market. Alphabet is up more than +8% after a judge ruled in an antitrust case late Tuesday that the company won't be forced to sell its Chrome browser. Also, Apple is up more than +3% after a court ruling stopped short of barring the company's lucrative search arrangement with Google, a deal that has generated roughly $20 billion in revenue a year for Apple. The weakness in energy producing stocks and energy service providers is a negative factor for the overall market today, with the price of WTI crude oil down more than -2%. US Jul JOLTS job openings fell -176,000 to a 10-month low of 7.181 million, showing a weaker labor market than expectations of 7.380 million. US Jul factory orders fell -1.3% m/m, right on expectations, and the second straight month orders have declined. US MBA mortgage applications fell -1.2% in the week ended August 29, with the purchase mortgage sub-index down -3.1% and the refinancing mortgage sub-index up +0.9%. The average 30-year fixed rate mortgage fell -5 bp to 6.64% from 6.69% in the prior week. Fed Governor Christopher Waller said the fed funds rate is currently above the neutral rate, meaning monetary policy is restricting the economy, and that inflation is likely to move ""much closer"" to the Fed's goal in six or seven months. He added that the Fed should aim to get ahead of a sharp slowdown in the job market and ""we need to start cutting interest rates at the next meeting"" and make multiple cuts in the coming months. St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem said, ""The current modestly restrictive setting of the policy rate is consistent with today's full employment labor market and core inflation nearly one percentage point above the Fed's 2% target,"" and it's important to take a ""balanced approach"" to policy right now and not weight too much to support the labor market or to fight inflation. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic reiterated that he sees one interest rate cut this year, as price stability remains his primary concern, and it's not unambiguously clear that the labor market is weakening materially. This week's US economic calendar is busy. Later today, the Fed's Beige Book will be released. On Thursday, the Aug ADP employment change is expected to increase by +80,000. Also, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to increase by +1,000 to 230,000, and Q2 nonfarm productivity is expected to be revised upward to 2.7% from the previously reported 2.4%, with Q2 unit labor costs expected to be revised downward to 1.4% from 1.6%. In addition, the Aug trade deficit is expected to widen to -$78.0 billion from -$60.2 billion in June. Finally, the Aug ISM services index is expected to climb by +0.8 to 50.9. On Friday, Aug nonfarm payrolls are expected to rise by +75,000, and the Aug unemployment rate is expected to rise by 0.1 to 4.3%. Aug average hourly earnings are expected to increase +0.3% m/m and +3.7% y/y. Regarding tariffs, a federal appeals court ruled late last Friday that President Trump exceeded his authority by imposing global tariffs without Congressional approval, but the court let the tariffs remain in place while appeals continue. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit Court said, ""The statute bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax."" The case now appears to be headed to the Supreme Court for a final decision. According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced. Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances of a -25 bp rate cut at 95% at the next FOMC meeting on September 16-17. The markets are discounting the chances at 53% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29. Overseas stock markets today are mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 is up +0.63%. China's Shanghai Composite closed down -1.16%. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -0.88%. Interest Rates December 10-year T-notes (ZNZ5) today are up +12 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield is down -4.5 bp to 4.217%. Dec T-notes are moving higher today after the US Jul JOLTS job openings fell more than expected to a 10-month low, boosting the chances for a Fed interest rate cut at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting to 95%, according to the swaps market. Also, today's 2% fall in WTI crude prices has reduced inflation expectations as the 10-year breakeven inflation rate fell to a 1.5-week low of 2.406%, a bullish factor for T-notes. However, T-notes remain under pressure from supply risks. About $55 billion of corporate debt securities are expected to be priced this week, which will prompt bond dealers to enter short positions on T-note futures as a hedge against the incoming supply. Also, investors are demanding higher yields for holding government debt in the face of spiraling budget deficits and sticky inflation. Finally, T-note yields are climbing on concerns over Fed independence, with President Trump trying to oust Fed Governor Cook. The worry is that Mr. Trump is trying to replace Cook and other Fed officials with policymakers more inclined to lower interest rates regardless of inflation risks. European government bond yields today are moving lower. The 10-year German bund yield is down -3.9 bp to 2.747%. 10-year UK gilt yield fell from a 7.5-month high of 4.845% and is down -5.0 bp to 4.750%. Eurozone July PPI eased +0.2% y/y from +0.6% y/y in June, slightly stronger than expectations of +0.1% y/y. The Eurozone Aug S&P composite PMI was revised downward by -0.1 to 51.0 from the previously reported 51.1.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly. Top Upgrades: - MoffettNathanson upgraded Apple (AAPL) to Neutral from Sell with a $225 price target. A number of key headwinds have faded and the ""worst-case scenarios are off the table,"" the firm tells investors. - Evercore ISI upgraded Brinker (EAT) to Outperform from In Line with a price target of $210, up from $190. The firm sees upside to consensus estimates in the near term and sustainable same-store sales growth potential from Brinker's improving customer satisfaction measures. - RBC Capital upgraded Leidos (LDOS) to Outperform from Sector Perform with a price target of $210, up from $180. The firm's bullish thesis is underpinned by continued strength and execution in Leidos' Health Services business, strong defense portfolio positioning, increased confidence under CEO Tom Bell and the revised strategic direction, the firm tells investors in a research note. - HSBC upgraded Copart (CPRT) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $62, up from $56. The firm says the stock's 20% decline since the fiscal Q3 results bring an attractive entry point. Top Downgrades: - Seaport Research downgraded AMD (AMD) to Neutral from Buy with no price target. Recent supply chain checks point to AMD seeing slowing growth in its AI accelerator business, the firm tells investors. - Gordon Haskett downgraded Dollar Tree (DLTR) to Reduce from Hold with a $95 price target. Following the Q2 earnings report, the firm remains concerned with Dollar Tree's move into higher price points. - Evercore ISI downgraded Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) to In Line from Outperform with a $190 price target. Texas Roadhouse continues to sustain strong same-store sales and traffic growth, but the firm is reducing its 2025 and 2026 EPS estimates as its base case now assumes double-digit beef inflation persists through the first half of 2026. - BofA downgraded Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) to Neutral from Buy with a $68 price target. The firm views the asset manager as ""not best positioned"" among peers for U.S. retail and 401(k) opportunities after President Trump's executive order; it calls Brookfield the ""most expensive asset manager in the world"" following the stock's price performance since April; it notes that Brookfield's capital intensity has increased; and it views the addition of the stock to the S&P 500 as ""unlikely"" over the near-term. - DA Davidson downgraded Duolingo (DUOL) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $300, down from $500.

Nvidia's earnings, which came in just ahead of Wall Street's estimates, largely received a bullish reception from analysts, who voiced confidence in demand for its AI hardware, though worries about China sales and geopolitical issues have weighed on the stock. Shares of Nvidia dropped nearly 3% in recent trading, and Broadcom shares slipped 1%, with other chip stocks extending last week's declines as uncertainty about tariffs and America's relations with major trading partners weighed on the major indexes. A diplomatic summit in Tianjin over the weekend with leaders from more than 20 non-Western countries, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Russian President Vladimir Putin, sought to showcase China's leadership amid trade tensions with the U.S. AI chipmaker Broadcom, which Oppenheimer analysts have called the ""No. 2 AI franchise"" after Nvidia, is set to report its fiscal third-quarter results after the bell on Thursday, and could face some similar challenges related to its large exposure to China—as well as benefit from AI tailwinds. Sales to China Account for Fifth of Broadcom's Revenue Like Nvidia, Broadcom derives a significant chunk of its sales from China, with the country accounting for roughly a fifth of Broadcom's revenue in its fiscal 2024, though that's declined from almost a third in 2023. Broadcom also claims some of the same Big Tech AI clients Nvidia does, including Meta Platforms (META) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), with their commitments to hefty AI spending expected to benefit the chipmaker. Citi analysts suggested last week Broadcom could also have plans with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Elon Musk's xAI, and Apple (AAPL) in its pipeline. The Citi analysts have a ""buy"" rating and $315 price target for the stock, which finished Friday's session around $297. Despite recent losses, it has added more than one-quarter of its value since the start of the year. Oppenheimer expects Broadcom could have even further to climb, with a $325 target, still well below a Street high of $350, according to Visible Alpha. Heading into the results, Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Broadcom's stock, anticipating rising sales and profits. All of the 10 analysts with current ratings compiled by Visible Alpha give it a ""buy"" or equivalent rating."

Regarding tariffs, a federal appeals court ruled late last Friday that President Trump exceeded his authority by imposing global tariffs without Congressional approval, but the court let the tariffs remain in place while appeals continue. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit Court said, ""The statute bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax."" The case now appears to be headed to the Supreme Court for a final decision. According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced. Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 89% at the next FOMC meeting on September 16-17.

European government bond yields today are moving higher. The 10-year German bund yield climbed to a 5-month high of 2.801% and is up +4.5 bp to 2.793%. 10-year UK gilt yield rose to a 7.5-month high of 4.822% and is up +4.6 bp to 4.796%.

Only a small handful of the Dow's constituents, however, did the bulk of this heavy lifting. Health insurer UnitedHealth Group (UNH -0.04%) led the way with its 24% advance, although the company itself didn't do anything to merit it. Rather, give credit to Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.70%) (BRK.B 0.78%), which announced a new 5-million-share stake in the struggling stock last month. Shares had fallen more than 60% from their April peak to early August's multiyear low on a near-halving of its full-year profit guidance (largely due to unexpectedly high reimbursement costs). Warren Buffett and Berkshire's lieutenants, however, clearly feel the sellers overshot their target. Investors interpreted Berkshire's interest as a bullish clue. Apple (AAPL 2.04%) finished a distant second to UnitedHealth, advancing nearly 12% last month. The company's solid fiscal third-quarter results posted in late July helped the stock hit the ground running in August. But an announcement of an additional $100 billion investment (bringing the total up to $600 billion) in its American manufacturing capacity that immunizes its iPhone from import tariffs arguably accounts for most of Apple stock's August gain. Finally, retailer Home Depot (HD 1.14%) and credit card issuer American Express (AXP 7.21%) tied for last month's third-best performance among the Dow's stocks, each with a gain of 10.7%. Home Depot shares edged higher all month long despite its Q2 top and bottom lines reported in mid-August both missing analyst estimates; investors saw enough glimmers of hope in the company's same-store sales growth of 1.4% and the reaffirmation of this year's earnings and revenue guidance. There was no major news from or about American Express released last month. Given its healthy Q2 numbers released in July, however, it easily plugged into the broad market bullishness. While these market-beating gains are compelling, interested investors will still want to do their usual due diligence before buying into any of these stocks."

Instead, they're cyclical, meaning their growth is lumpy and episodic, and tends to fluctuate with commodity prices. But times are changing: The world economy needs more metals, especially rare-earth metals. Many of the companies whose names are inseparable from growth (including The Magnificent Seven) depend on increasing amounts of processed materials to build smarter, more efficient, and faster technology. Mining companies sit on the bedrock of this growth -- literally. As I look at the mining landscape in the U.S. today, here are two mining stocks that deserve a closer look. MP Materials MP Materials (MP -3.92%) operates the only active rare-earth metal mining and processing facility in the U.S. -- the Mountain Pass site in California. As such, it sits at the heart of the U.S.'s push to build a domestic rare earth supply chain, which up until now has been dominated by Chinese companies. The strategic importance of MP cannot be overstated. Indeed, rare-earth magnets, which contain neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) -- the metal MP specializes in -- are critical ingredients in EV motors, wind turbines, electronics, and defense systems. Not only does the Mountain Pass mine have large economically viable quantities of NdPr, but MP is gradually scaling up its capacity to process concentrates into high-performance magnets. A few years ago, it had to ship unrefined ore overseas to China for processing. Now, with its Forth Worth facility -- and its expected 10X facility in 2028 -- MP is beginning to control the full operational chain on U.S. soil, from mining to processing to magnet production. Domestic support for the company's operations has been growing louder, especially with tension between China and the U.S. rearing up. In mid-2025, MP announced two blockbuster partnerships, a $500 long-term supply agreement with Apple (AAPL 2.04%) and a $400 million preferred stock deal with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). The agreement with the DoD also established a price floor for NdPr oxide of $110 per kilogram. Investors have rewarded these moves handsomely. The stock is up over 340% on the year and about 460% year over year. Those growth rates are rarely seen for a materials stock. Still, one shouldn't get bullish from share prices alone: The company reported an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) loss of $0.13. In other words, the company is losing money. Of course, it's expected, as MP recently cut ties with its biggest purchaser in China, Shenghe Resources. For investors who want to see concrete results, however, or at least the processing capacity to meet growing demands, a stake in a young mining company might be too much volatility to swallow. But for those seeking growth in an industry that tends to be cyclical, MP Materials' current price might be the right opening before operations kick up a notch. The Metals Company Speaking of ""young mining companies,"" The Metals Company (TMC -5.75%), is chasing a plan that once sounded like science fiction -- vacuuming polymetallic rocks from the ocean floor. The idea is simple, if not easy: harvest potato-sized ""nodules"" packed with nickel, cobalt, copper, and manganese from the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, where TMC currently holds extensive exploration rights. Like MP Materials, it's hard to overstate the opportunity. Polymetallic nodules are so dense in metals, they're like an EV battery packed into a lumpy stone. Harvesting these rocks would also be less capital-intensive than, say, mining them straight out of the ground. Unlike MP, however, TMC is pre-revenue and faces significant challenges to becoming profitable. Chief among them is regulatory: The International Seabed Authority (ISA), which regulates the area in which TMC wants to mine, hasn't finalized rules for commercial deep-sea mining yet. While the U.S. never ratified the treaty that created the ISA -- leaving TMC with a potential alternative if Washington wants to push its own permitting process in the name of securing critical metals -- the company remains effectively at a standstill until the ISA finishes its rulebook. The company reported about $116 million in total cash at the end of the second quarter. At today's $20 million quarterly cash burn rate, it has about five to six quarters of runway before it'll need a fresh capital injection. Unless spending slows or a partner steps in, additional financing may become inevitable. And for shareholders, that could mean dilution. Even after a recent sell-off, the company has a $2 billion market cap. That's a lot for a pre-revenue mining stock, but not so much if the company starts harvesting its multi-billion mineral reserves soon. Investors who believe TMC can pull it off would be smart to pick up shares at today's price, as another milestone, such a regulatory approval, could send it soaring."

",https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/27/warren-buffett-bershire-hathaway-trims-apple-stake/?source=iedfolrf0000001,www.fool.com,20250827T211500Z,semi,0.65,"Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.70%) (BRK.B 0.78%) first purchased shares in Apple (AAPL 2.04%) more than nine years ago in the first quarter of 2016. Warren Buffett, who oversees capital allocation decisions for the conglomerate, realized that Apple was a powerful and durable consumer brand. That investment has worked out quite well, as the ""Magnificent Seven"" stock is up 766% since the start of 2016 (as of Aug. 26). However, the Oracle of Omaha has seemingly become less bullish. Since Q4 2023, Berkshire has sold 635 million shares of Apple, with sales happening in five of the past seven quarters. Just in this year's Q2, 20 million shares were divested. The current Apple stake is valued at $64 billion, representing 21.4% of Berkshire's portfolio. Apple remains the largest single position for the Buffett-led business, as it owns 280 million shares of the tech giant. But what's the deal with these recent moves? Apple isn't a no-brainer opportunity One possible reason for the significant reduction in the Apple position could come down to the simple fact that this is no longer a home run investment opportunity. When Berkshire first started buying shares nearly a decade ago, Apple shares traded at a much cheaper valuation. This is no longer the case, with the stock selling for a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 34.6, well above its trailing five- and 10-year averages. Of course, this is one of the world's greatest businesses. As a result, it's easy to argue that Apple deserves that valuation. However, Buffett probably doesn't see the potential to achieve strong returns from this point forward. Apple's growth has slowed. To be fair, it did register a 9.6% year-over-year revenue gain in Q3 (ended June 28). But that pace isn't sustainable. Apple's sales were up just 13.4% from the same period exactly three years ago. It's difficult to expand meaningfully from such a high revenue base, while also selling hardware devices that are already widely adopted. Anticipating potential tax changes Buffett has been a leader in the business and investing worlds for decades. Because of this, and demonstrated by his incredible success, he's perhaps in tune with the landscape more than anyone else. The Apple share sales could have something to do with the Oracle of Omaha's view that changes will come to tax policy in the future. It's hard to predict how different presidential administrations will alter the tax code. Buffett might be on to something, though. The U.S. federal debt sits at an alarming $36 trillion, as it has soared since the Great Recession. And the government operates with huge fiscal deficits. There is really no end in sight to this trend. It makes sense to believe that taxes could be increased to fund the government. The current corporate tax rate is 21%. On a historical basis, this is extremely low. Additionally, the capital gains tax could also rise in the future. Taking sizable profits off the table before Uncle Sam potentially demands more money looks like a smart move on Buffett's part. Getting ready for Greg Abel Berkshire has been a net seller of stocks. As someone who prioritizes investing with a margin of safety in his decision-making process, Buffett might not only be concerned about Apple's P/E multiple but also the valuation of the overall market. This could explain Berkshire's monster $344 billion cash position. Buffett is set to retire as CEO at the end of this year. He could be making these moves to give his successor, Greg Abel, more financial firepower to play with. Apple is arguably the Oracle of Omaha's best investment decision. Now he wants Abel to build his own legacy. It might be a good idea for Apple shareholders to think deeply about the reasons Berkshire and Buffett have been selling Apple. Perhaps it's a good time to follow these moves."

September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) fell -0.54%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) fell -1.37%. Stock indexes settled mixed on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq 100 falling to a 1.5-week low and the Dow Jones industrials posting a new all-time high. Tuesday’s selloff in chip makers and the Magnificent Seven megacap technology stocks weighed on the overall market. On the positive side, Home Depot recovered from early losses and closed up more than +3% to push the Dow Jones industrials to a new record high after it reported a +3% jump in July comparable same-store sales. Lowes and Target will report their earnings on Wednesday, and Walmart will report on Thursday. Lower bond yields on Tuesday were supportive of stocks, as the 10-year T-note yield fell -3 bp to 4.30%. US government debt garnered support Tuesday after S&P Global Ratings affirmed its AA+ long-term rating and A-1+ short-term rating on US debt and said the US can maintain its credit strength despite the fiscal hit of its recent spending bill because tariff revenues will “generally offset weaker fiscal outcomes.” Tuesday’s US housing news was mixed. US Jul housing starts unexpectedly rose +5.2% m/m to a 5-month high of 1.428 million, stronger than expectations of a decline to 1.297 million. However, Jul building permits, a proxy for future construction, fell -2.8% m/m to a 5-year low of 1.354 million, weaker than expectations of -0.5% m/m to 1.386 million. Diplomatic talks over the war in Ukraine continue to make headway. Ukrainian President Zelenskiy said he came away with a commitment from President Trump late Monday to join security guarantees for any peace deal and reserve discussion on territorial swaps with Russia for later. President Trump is pushing for a summit between Presidents Putin and Zelenskiy soon, and European leaders are discussing a plan to send British and French troops to Ukraine as part of a peace agreement. The outcome of the talks could have macroeconomic implications regarding tariffs and oil prices, and could, of course, have significant consequences for European security. The focus of the markets this week will be on any new tariff news and signs of progress toward a Ukraine peace deal. On Wednesday, the minutes of the July 29-30 FOMC meeting will be released. On Thursday, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to climb by +1,000 to 225,000 and the Aug Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey is expected to fall to 6.7 from 15.9 in July. Also, the Aug S&P manufacturing PMI is expected to remain unchanged at 49.8. In addition, Jul existing home sales are expected to fall -0.3% m/m to 3.92 million. On Friday, Fed Chair Powell speaks on the economic outlook at the Federal Reserve’s annual symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Regarding tariffs, President Trump widened steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 consumer items that contain the metals, such as motorcycles, auto parts, furniture components, and tableware. The change went into effect on Monday and did not exclude goods already in transit. Last Friday, Mr. Trump said, “I’ll be setting tariffs next week and the week after on steel and on, I would say chips – chips and semiconductors, we’ll be setting sometime next week, week after.” Mr. Trump last week said he planned a 100% tariff on semiconductors but would exempt companies that move chip manufacturing to the US. Mr. Trump also mentioned 200% or 300% tariffs on chips. In other recent tariff news, Mr. Trump last Tuesday extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November. On August 6, Mr. Trump announced that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India’s purchases of Russian oil. On August 5, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced “within the next week or so.” According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced. Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 87% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting, down from 93% last Thursday. The markets are discounting the chances at 54% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29. Earnings reports indicate that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With over 92% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, about 82% of companies exceeded profit estimates. Overseas stock markets on Tuesday settled mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 rose to a 4.75-month high and closed up +0.89%. China’s Shanghai Composite fell from a 10-year high and closed down -0.02%. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 retreated from a new record high and closed down -0.38%. Interest Rates September 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) Tuesday closed up +8 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield fell -3.2 bp to 4.302%. Sep T-notes rallied Tuesday after S&P Global Ratings said that higher revenues from tariffs will help soften the blow to the US’s fiscal health from the president’s tax cuts, enabling the country to maintain its AA+ long-term credit rating. The weakness in stocks on Tuesday also supported safe-haven demand for T-notes. Gains in T-notes were limited due to concerns that last week’s bearish US July CPI and PPI reports could keep the Fed from cutting interest rates at next month’s FOMC meeting. European government bond yields on Tuesday were mixed. The 10-year German bund yield fell -1.3 bp to 2.750%. The 10-year UK gilt yield rose to a 2.5-month high of 4.756% and finished up by +0.2 bp to 4.740%. Swaps are discounting the chances at 7% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting. US Stock Movers The weakness in the Magnificent Seven stocks on Tuesday was a drag on the overall market. Nvidia (NVDA) closed down more than -3%, and Meta Platforms (META) closed down more than -2%. Also, Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) closed down more than -1%. In addition, Apple (AAPL) fell -0.14%. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) closed down more than -5% to lead chipmakers lower after GF Securities downgraded the stock to hold from buy. Also, Marvell Technology (MRVL) closed down more than -5%, and ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) closed down more than -4%. In addition, Broadcom (AVGO) closed down more than -3%, and Qualcomm (QCOM), Microchip Technology (MCHP), ON Semiconductor (ON), GlobalFoundries (GFS), NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI), and Micron Technology (MU) closed down more than -1%. Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) closed down more than -42% after a Phase 2 trial of its oral weight loss drug showed 28% of patients discontinued treatment over tolerability concerns. Fabrinet (FN) closed down more than -12% after it said it expects to see a sequential dip in datacom segment revenue in its fiscal Q1, citing supply constraints for some critical components. Amer Sports (AS) closed down more than -4% after forecasting Q3 adjusted operating margin of 12% to 13%, below the consensus of 13%.

Should You Buy INTC Stock Here ? ,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/softbank-betting-2-billion-intel-181255322.html,finance.yahoo.com,20250821T053000Z,semi,0.65,"Intel (INTC) stock soared over 10% on Tuesday after the Japanese conglomerate Softbank (SFTBY) announced a $2 billion investment (about a 2% stake) in the multinational chip manufacturer. Investors are running into INTC this morning also on President Donald Trump’s administration’s plans of taking a 10% stake in the beleaguered semiconductor firm as well. More News from Barchart Despite ongoing challenges, Intel stock has been a lucrative investment in August. Versus the start of this month, it’s up roughly 35% at the time of writing. Why SoftBank’s Stake Bodes Wells for Intel Stock Softbank’s investment is bullish for INTC shares as it essentially is a major vote of confidence in the company’s new management and its turnaround strategy at large. The announcement reiterates Intel’s pivotal role in revitalizing U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and boosts its overall financial stability in the near term. The capital injection could help INTC’s foundry business to accelerate its push into next-gen chip technologies, which may help attract new customers over time. Simply put, Softbank’s stake lifts investor sentiment that may translate to significant further upside for Intel shares over time. UBS Says INTC Shares Could Soar to $40 According to UBS analysts, a federal stake could prove a major tailwind for INTC stock, especially if the U.S. government urges the likes of Broadcom (AVGO), Nvidia (NVDA), and Apple (AAPL) to boost their business with Intel. “An upside case could potentially come to fruition if the U.S. government pushes these companies to engage more immediately with Intel on foundry services,” they told clients in a research note on Tuesday. In fact, Intel could be worth as much as $40 in the bull-case scenario where its chip manufacturing business is valued similarly to global peers, UBS analysts added. Their best-case forecast indicates potential for another 50% upside in INTC shares from here. What’s the Consensus Rating on Intel? At the time of writing, the consensus rating on Intel stock sits at “Hold” only with the mean target of about $23 indicating potential downside of more than 10% from current levels."

""NVDA is now the most under-owned large-cap tech stock,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in a note. Though the chipmaker has grown into the world's most valuable company, investors don't hold it in line with its S&P 500 (^GSPC) weight. According to Woodring, Nvidia's market value accounts for 7.37% of the index, but its share in the average active institutional portfolio is 4.2%, an adjusted underweight of 2.41 percentage points. The gap is the largest of any of the 15 major tech companies Morgan Stanley's team tracks. The disconnect highlights Nvidia's unique position. Its stock has been one of the best-performing names — up nearly 1,300% in the past five years — thanks to the AI boom. But its rapid rise and ongoing risks tied to geopolitics and supply chains have made some investors hesitant to load up. History shows that underowned stocks often get pulled higher over time as investors gradually increase their holdings to match the stock's weight in the index. ""There is a statistically significant relationship between low active ownership ... and future stock performance,"" Morgan Stanley wrote. By comparison, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN) are also underowned, but not to Nvidia's extent. Microsoft was underweight by 2.39%, Apple by 1.66%, and Amazon by 1.40%. In contrast, the most overowned tech stocks include Intuit (INTU) at +0.83%, Oracle (ORCL) at +0.32%, and Dell (DELL) at +0.25%. Despite the underweighting, Nvidia's fundamentals remain solid. ""Leading indicators of compute demand remain exceptionally strong with no signs of slowing,"" the firm's analysts wrote. ""As supply chain constraints around rack-scale solutions ease and the U.S. government advances export license approvals for China, we continue to view Nvidia as a premier asset in the current era of AI dominance."" Nvidia's stock has been up 33% in 2025, outperforming the S&P 500's 10% advance. Much of the optimism stems from demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs), used for AI and cloud-based enterprise applications. Still, not everyone is on board with the bullish sentiment surrounding megacap stocks. Torsten Sløk, Apollo Management's chief economist, previously told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.) At the time, he pointed to internal data showing that the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of the 10 largest S&P 500 companies, including AI stocks like Meta (META) and Nvidia, had surpassed levels seen during the dot-com bubble in 1999."

The stock of the multinational technology giant is still down slightly in 2025 but popped over 10% in the last week after management announced new planned spending in the U.S. CEO Tim Cook even visited the White House in a joint press conference with President Donald Trump to announce this new planned spending on components for the iPhone as well as other Apple products in America. It has helped the company achieve some breathing room around potential tariffs on semiconductors, iPhone components, and iPhones themselves getting imported to America. Apple's stock got its mojo back on this upsized spending news, but should you actually buy shares today? Here's what the numbers say. A $600 billion investment Earlier this year, Apple announced that it would spend $500 billion over the next four years in the United States. Last week, it upped its estimate to $600 billion, or $150 billion annually. This is different than a company's announced capital expenditure plans, such as when Amazon promises $100 billion in investments related to data centers and its delivery network. Apple is spending money with its suppliers, including advanced glass screens and various semiconductor manufacturers. It is more of an announcement around committed orders for products, which will spur demand for factory work in the United States. Apple is a sprawling company, and the announced spending will occur in all 50 states, impact 450,000 jobs, and involve 79 different factories. It is astounding how complex Apple's supply chain for the iPhone and other computing hardware is today. However, Apple is still not at the point of a ""Made in America iPhone"" as assembly and other services are performed in China and India, with Apple negotiating with the U.S. government around what is feasible to bring to the United States. Investors applauded the spending plans as a way to shy away from tariff risks on iPhone and semiconductor imports, which could have added huge costs to Apple's supply chain, damaging its profits. Now, it seems to be in good standing with the U.S. government and regulation authorities again. Does the announcement matter? In regard to tariffs, this spending announcement won't necessarily hurt the company, it just prevents Apple from having future cost increases across its supply chain. However, since the U.S. has higher salaries and labor standards, this investment may lead to higher input costs for product components, which could lead to margin compression. Apple's operating margin has steadily risen since the COVID-19 pandemic, hitting a record high of 32% over the last 12 months. Sourcing components in the United States may reverse this expansion. What matters more at the end of the day is demand for Apple's products. Last quarter, the company released solid figures for the three months ending in June. Total revenue grew just under 10% year over year, driven by services revenue and iPhone revenue growth. Even though the iPhone is almost 20 years old, it remains the bread and butter of Apple's business today. This puts the company in a tough spot. Even though the iPhone remains wildly popular, unit volumes have stagnated for years, meaning Apple is only able to grow revenue by increasing prices. This is not an ideal position to be in. Price increases may be necessary just to maintain profit margins in the future if input costs grow due to the Made-in-America investments. All in all, this announcement does matter. It just might be a negative for Apple's business, contrary to the stock's initial reaction. The truth about Apple stock There are a lot of arguments to be made -- both bearish and bullish -- for Apple stock. Bulls might say this is a fantastic brand with major lock-in effects along with a growing services division with strong profit margins. Bears may say that Apple's unit volumes for the iPhone have fallen with no new successful products coming down the pipeline. For example, the Apple Vision Pro has turned into a total product bust, likely losing the company billions if not tens of billions of dollars. A deciding factor in this debate could be the stock's valuation. Apple's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is 35. This is quite expensive for a business with low revenue growth. Compare that to Alphabet, which has grown its revenue significantly faster than Apple over the last few years but trades at a more reasonable P/E ratio of 22. Apple may be a great business, but that doesn't mean you should ignore the price you pay when analyzing its stock. Avoid buying shares of Apple after this post-announcement pop."

September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) are up +0.13%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) are down -0.03%. The S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq 100 Index both posted new record highs today but have since fallen back. US stocks continue to see support from strengthening expectations for interest rate cuts through year-end as Treasury Secretary Bessent weighed in with his call for a 150-175 bp rate cut. Stocks are seeing support from today's sharp -6 bp decline in the 10-year T-note yield. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent today said that interest rates are ""too constrictive"" and that rates ""should probably be 150, 175 basis points lower."" He added, ""There's a very good chance of a 50 basis point cut. We could go into a series of rate cuts here, starting with a 50 basis point rate cut in September."" The Fed is currently targeting the federal funds rate in the range of 4.25%-4.50% and the effective rate is currently at 4.33%. The markets have started to think about the chances for a -50 basis point rate cut in September, based on Monday's largely benign CPI report and the fact that the US labor market is slowing, with average monthly payroll growth in May-July of only +35,000. On a year-on-year basis, Tuesday's July headline CPI of +2.7% y/y was slightly weaker than expected, but the core CPI of +3.1% y/y was slightly stronger than expected. The federal funds futures market today boosted the odds to 100% for a -25 bp rate cut in September and a slight 1% chance of a -50 bp rate cut. The market late Tuesday was discounting the odds of a -25 bp rate cut in September at 96%, up from 40% before the July payroll report released on August 1. The federal funds futures market is currently discounting an overall -64 bp rate cut by the end of this year to 3.69%, and an overall -136 bp rate cut to 2.97% by the end of 2026. The markets are awaiting this Friday's Trump-Putin summit in Alaska for any progress in ending the Russian-Ukrainian war. President Trump on Monday downplayed expectations of a breakthrough, saying the summit is a ""feel-out meeting"" to end the war in Ukraine. Also, recent comments from Ukrainian President Zelenskiy dampened hopes for a quick end to the war when he rejected any talk of Ukraine ceding territory to Russia. In recent tariff news, President Trump early Tuesday extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November. Last Wednesday, Mr. Trump announced that he will impose a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports. Still, companies would be eligible for exemptions if they demonstrate a commitment to building their products in the US. However, the US will levy a separate tax on imports of electronic products that employ semiconductors. Also, Mr. Trump announced last Wednesday that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil. Last Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced ""within the next week or so."" According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced. The market's focus this week is on corporate earnings results and any new trade or tariff news. On Thursday, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to fall by -1,000 to 225,000. Also on Thursday, the July final-demand PPI is expected to increase to +2.5% y/y from +2.3% y/y in June, and the July PPI ex-food and energy is expected to rise to +2.9% y/y from +2.6% y/y in June. On Friday, July US retail sales are expected to climb +0.5% m/m and retail sales ex-autos are expected to rise +0.3% m/m. Also on Friday, July manufacturing production is expected to remain unchanged m/m. Finally, the University of Michigan's Aug US consumer sentiment index is expected to climb by +0.3 to 62.0. Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 100% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting and at 70% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29. Earnings reports indicate that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With over 82% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, about 82% of companies exceeded profit estimates. Overseas stock markets today are higher. The Euro Stoxx 50 is up +0.92%. China's Shanghai Composite today rallied to a 3.75-year high and closed up +0.48%. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 today closed up +1.30% and posted a new record high. Interest Rates September 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) are up +15 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield is down -6.2 bp at 4.227%. T-note prices are higher as expectations strengthen for interest rate cuts through year-end. T-note prices have underlying support from Tuesday's CPI report, which was largely in line with market expectations and did not contain any nasty surprises. The 10-year breakeven inflation expectations rate today is down -0.3 bp at 2.384%, adding to Tuesday's -1.3 bp decline. European government bond yields today are lower. The 10-year German bund yield is down -6.5 bp at 2.679%. The 10-year UK gilt yield is down -3.8 bp at 4.588%.

The Asia-Pacific region currently dominates the market, holding a share of 39.4% in 2024 due to its strong manufacturing base, technological improvements, and robust consumer electronics industry. The region's significant investments in research, along with its role as a hub for semiconductor production, further solidify its dominance, Imarc said. Micron Technology (MU) has seen a dramatic surge in DRAM sales. Micron CEO Mehrotra: AI adoption 'a key driver' The Boise, Idaho, company, which makes memory and storage chips for data centers, computers and smartphones, boosted its fiscal-fourth-quarter-earnings outlook, citing improved DRAM pricing and strong execution. Micron, the largest U.S.-based memory-chip manufacturer, now expects to earn an adjusted $2.85 a share on revenue of $11.2 billion in the quarter ending Aug. 28. More Tech Stocks: - Analyst reboots SoFi Technologies price target after capital raise - Amazon makes surprising decision to cut losses on recent deal Analysts were looking for earnings of $2.51 a share on revenue of $10.75 billion. Micron had previously guided to fiscal Q4 adjusted earnings of $2.50 a share on sales of $10.7 billion. In the year-earlier quarter the company earned an adjusted $1.18 a share on revenue of $7.75 billion. Micron's fiscal third-quarter revenue DRAM reached $7.1 billion, up 51% from a year earlier and accounting for 76% of its total. “AI adoption remains a key driver of DRAM content growth for smartphones, and we expect more smartphone launches featuring 12 gigabytes or more compared to eight gigabytes of capacity in the average smartphone today,” Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra told analysts during the third-quarter-earnings call in June. Mehrotra said the company had completed “a strategic reorganization of our business units around key market segments to capitalize on the tremendous AI growth opportunity ahead.” The company, which beat Wall Street's fiscal-Q3 earnings and revenue forecasts, said data-center DRAM revenue had reached a record for a fourth consecutive quarter. Chris Versace, lead manager for the TheStreet Pro's portfolio was impressed with Micron's revised guidance. ""That is the latest in a string of positive data points that inform us [that] demand for AI and data center chips is robust,"" he wrote in his Aug. 11 column. ""It may also confirm that the expected seasonal strength in smartphones and PCs is starting to play out."" Analyst notes improving DRAM sales Versace said that over the past few weeks he and the rest of the market digested the prospects for higher capital spending levels from Meta (META) , Alphabet (GOOGL) , Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) . ""Last week, July revenue reports from Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Foxconn (FXCOF) underscored the ongoing strength in AI and data center demand, with Foxconn sharing that it sees its connected device end market entering the peak season in [second-half] 2025,"" he said.

After months of worries over ever-costlier tariffs on imported goods -- including its all-important iPhone -- Apple is now (mostly) off the hook. The White House announced on Wednesday that in exchange for an additional $100 billion worth of investment in American manufacturing of the tech used in its devices, Apple would be exempt from the 100% import tariff President Donald Trump has recently threatened for any semiconductors shipped into the United States. The specifics of the exemption and Apple's plans still aren't clear, nor is it clear they ever will be. Apple also seemingly made the investment decision independent of President Trump's involvement, yet Apple CEO Tim Cook was still present when the president made the announcement from the White House on Wednesday. The president only explained of the newly proposed chip and semiconductor tariff that ""the good news for companies like Apple is if you're building in the United States or have committed to build, without question, committed to build in the United States, there will be no charge."" What is clear, however, is that Apple and its shareholders are better off with Tim Cook working with the U.S. president than they are by working around him. A complicated moving target If it seems like President Trump's tariffs are forever changing, you're not imagining things. They are. He's maneuvering in response to companies' efforts to sidestep his previously imposed tariffs. For instance, after February's announcement of an additional 10% import tariff on goods made in China -- where most iPhones are still assembled -- was eventually pumped up to 54%, Apple soon began working to shift more iPhone production to India. Trump countered in April with an additional 26% tariff on goods exported from India to the United States, and in May specifically threatened a 25% tariff on U.S. iPhones regardless of where they were manufactured. In the meantime, in response to the country's continued purchases of crude oil from Russia, the White House has punitively imposed an additional 25% tariff on all of India's goods imported into the United States. It seems Apple, however, will be sidestepping at least a significant chunk of these additional costs. By agreeing to raise its previous investment commitment in American manufacturing of technological components from $500 billion to $600 billion, Trump says Apple isn't subject to the 100% import tariff on semiconductors that other chip companies like Intel could soon be paying. Although the time frame isn't necessarily linked to the exemption, Apple says this investment will be deployed over the course of the coming four years, positively impacting 79 U.S. factories managed by 10 manufacturing partners including Corning, Texas Instruments, and Broadcom, just to name a few. Arguably of most interest to Trump is the fact that Apple's so-called American Manufacturing Program should support as many as 450,000 domestic jobs. What it means for Apple shareholders There is no executive order yet declaring Apple or any other outfit exempt from any of Trump's tariffs, for the record -- only the president's spoken statements at Wednesday's press conference, which didn't clarify if the entirety of an imported iPhone is exempt, or only the value of the chips and semiconductors found inside it. There's also no clarity as to how microchips made within the United States that are shipped to overseas assemblers that then ship completed products back to the U.S. will be handled. As such, take all of it with a grain of salt. Even without such details, though, Apple has scored a couple of respectable wins here. One of these wins is very specific: a reduction in the amount of tariffs it's been paying of late. The company reported $800 million in tariff costs for the quarter ending in June in the shadow of recent tariff hikes, and predicted $1.1 billion worth of tariff expenses for the three-month stretch set to end in September. For perspective, Apple turned $94 billion worth of revenue into net income of $23.4 billion in what was a relatively typical June quarter, and is expected to report a top line of $101.5 billon for the quarter currently underway. Although not all of this total import cost is going away, presumably a sizable chunk of it will be. Apple should be at least slightly more profitable thanks to this recent development, although not by leaps and bounds. The bigger win here is a purely subjective but incredibly important one. By giving the president a highly visible win of his own as well as a key talking point he can now leverage, Apple and its CEO Tim Cook are back in Donald Trump's good graces. More to the point, by virtue of being a high-profile American company that Trump now wants -- and even needs -- to thrive, it's likely that the president will largely leave Apple out of the crosshairs of future tariffs and executive orders. Enough reason to buy? But is this reason enough to buy Apple stock? Truth be told, while all the newly introduced tariffs were highly criticized and created a great deal of investor angst, they were never a reason not to own Apple shares. Oh, they're certainly a cost. There's also no denying Apple was caught in the middle of what was ultimately a complicated geopolitical battle between a handful of industrialized countries' leaders. These tariffs were never an existential threat to the company, however. Last quarter's 13% year-over-year improvement in iPhone revenue against a tariff-laden backdrop says as much. Still, to the extent tariff worries were holding an otherwise bullish Apple stock back, that ceiling is no longer in place. The bullish argument is even stronger now. That's particularly true given the company's regrouped artificial intelligence efforts. It expects much of this consumer-facing tech to be of true Apple caliber by next year, including an upgraded version of Siri, AI-enabled glasses, and some of the anticipated features of Apple Intelligence that were missing when the platform was first launched in October of last year. And the underlying opportunity is big to be sure. All told, Global Insight Services expects this consumer-facing sliver of the artificial intelligence market to grow at an average annual pace of 22% through 2034. Apple's powerful brand name along with its new and improved AI tech position it to win more than its fair share of this market's growth. The tariff exemption only makes doing so even easier."

Although the market's rally to record highs -- and steep valuations -- might make it feel like there's not much worth stepping into at this time, worthy opportunities are out there. You just have to dig deeper to find them, and perhaps look a bit off of the beaten path. With that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three growth stocks to consider scooping up sooner than later, while each is still underpriced thanks to recent but unmerited weakness. 1. Upstart Yes, Upstart (UPST -2.76%) shares stumbled on Wednesday in response to its second-quarter report. Although revenue of $257.3 million topped analysts' expectations of $226.5 million and adjusted per-share earnings of $0.36 beat expectations of only $0.25, the Q2 earnings call highlighted lingering risks like inflation and competition. Investors took that ball and ran with it, dragging UPST shares down 19% for the day. The market, however, arguably lost all perspective on the matter. Revenue still doubled year over year, and the company went from an operating loss of $55.5 million in the comparable quarter a year earlier to operating income of $4.5 million this time around. Best of all, Upstart's guidance for the rest of the year also suggests this degree of growth should persist at least through the end of the year. Indeed, analysts are calling for a top line of more than $1.5 billion for 2027, versus this year's projected revenue of just over $1.0 billion while annual per-share profits are expected to grow from $1.51 to $3.12 during the same three-year span. It looks like Upstart's business is here to stay. But what is its business? In simplest terms, Upstart is a new kind of credit-scoring bureau. Although plenty of banks and lenders still rely on information from Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian when making lending decisions about potential borrowers, their credit-risk assessments aren't necessarily the most accurate anymore. Using an artificial intelligence algorithm that considers more than 1,600 different data points, Upstart's approach allows for 43% more loan approvals with no more defaults than the more commonly used scoring system from credit bureaus. Lenders are finally catching on, too. The total number of loans the company's tech facilitated jumped 159% last quarter as well. 2. MercadoLibre Much like Upstart's stock, MercadoLibre (MELI -0.89%) shares initially tanked in response to Monday afternoon's release of its second-quarter earnings. Revenue of $6.79 billion beat estimates of $6.67 billion, but earnings of $10.31 per share fell well short of the expected $11.93. Although the stock fought its way back to a gain on Tuesday, it's been rough sailing ever since. The stock's now down about 5% from its post-earnings peak, and more than 12% below May's record high and still testing new multi-week lows. As with Upstart, investors may be missing the much bigger bullish picture here. See, MercadoLibre is an all-encompassing e-commerce platform that's often compared to Amazon, frequently referred to as ""the Amazon of Latin America"" in a nod to its growing dominance of the region's e-commerce arena. If it wants to truly become the Amazon of that particular market, though, it must do there what Amazon did here. That's offering free shipping even if it hurts profit margins -- which it did last quarter. But in the long run the trade-off is worth it, particularly given the fragmented nature of Latin America's online shopping industry, making it still up for grabs. And the opportunity is enormous. With broadband internet and smartphones just now becoming common in the region, Payments and Commerce Market Intelligence expects Latin America's e-commerce industry to double in size between 2023 and 2027, when it will be worth more than $1 trillion. The thing is, MercadoLibre is clearly cashing in on this growth. Although it missed its second-quarter earnings estimates, revenue was up 34% year over year. And while operating income only improved a relatively modest 14%, the reason is neither surprising nor troubling -- it was the free shipping it offered to Brazil's consumers that ate into its profit margins. Again, the short-term pain is worth the long-term growth the free shipping perk sets up. 3. Apple Finally, add Apple (AAPL 2.04%) to your list of growth stocks to buy if you've got $1,000 (or more) you're ready to put to work. No, it's not off the beaten path the way Upstart and MercadoLibre are. Apple is currently the world's third-biggest publicly traded company, sporting a market cap of nearly $3.3 trillion. Like MercadoLibre and Upstart, though, Apple's stock is undervalued thanks to unmerited weakness since late last year. Blame its fumbled entry into the era of on-device artificial intelligence, mostly. When Apple Intelligence was first unveiled in June of last year, consumers as well as investors were excited that the tech would turn their iPhones and iPads into stand-alone generative AI devices. September's introduction of the newest mobile devices capable of running Apple Intelligence stoked further optimism. Then October's actual release of Apple Intelligence tech was met with cheers. By December, however, consumers and analysts were largely in agreement that the onboard AI tool just didn't live up to the hype. Apple's stock has been struggling since, in the shadow of failure that the world's not accustomed to seeing from this iconic company. There's hope on the horizon, though. While it took a painful wake-up call to get the ball rolling, Apple has spent the past several months restructuring and rethinking its entire approach to consumer-facing artificial intelligence. It's also likely come to appreciate that it's better to wait until a new tech is fully ready before launching it. In this vein, the company now says the next version of its AI-powered digital assistant Siri won't be released until early in the coming year, just to make sure it's truly ready. While it's been a relatively ugly stretch for the company, just bear in mind that stocks reflect their underlying company's future rather than their past. And Apple's future looks bright in light of Precedence Research's outlook for the intelligence virtual assistant market, which it expects to grow at an average annual pace of 24% through 2034. The irony is that investors are already seeing glimmers of hope from Apple even before it's fully regrouped. Last quarter's top line was up 10% year over year, led by iPhone revenue growth despite plenty of nay-saying about the most recent versions of the device. Analysts are still calling for a slower growth pace ahead, but AAPL stock's strong rally since the late-July release of last quarter's results suggests investors may be expecting more. The thing is, in this instance, the trading crowd may well be right."

Revenue soared 9.6% year over year to $94 billion, while diluted earnings per share climbed 12.1%. These headline figures beat Wall Street estimates. Despite the upbeat results, Apple shares have disappointed. They're down 15% in 2025 (as of Aug. 6). And in the last 12 months, they are essentially flat. The S&P 500 index is up 22% during the same time. This trend doesn't inspire confidence among the investment community. The general view is that Apple has so far fallen behind in the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) race. Apple Intelligence, its AI system that's integrated with its devices and software, has launched 20 different features for users. But it hasn't exactly had that wow factor that people are accustomed to seeing from Apple. There was also supposed to be an AI-powered Siri launching in late 2024. However, this more personalized voice assistant won't be introduced until sometime in 2026. Big tech peers have gone full steam ahead in the meantime, while it appears that Apple is playing catch-up. On the latest earnings call, though, CEO Tim Cook gave investors a reason to be bullish. ""We see AI as one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime,"" he said on the Q3 2025 earnings call. Maybe he's finally starting to regard AI as a serious paradigm shift that can have huge implications for his business. Apple is raising the amount of money it's spending on AI-related capital expenditures (capex). CFO Kevan Parekh said capex spending ""is going to grow substantially."" In Q3, the company's capex totaled $3.5 billion. Mergers and acquisitions could be part of the plan. Therefore, investors shouldn't be surprised for Apple to push more aggressively into AI initiatives. This seems to be the right move from a strategic perspective. At the end of the day, it's all about Apple being able to bolster its competitive position. It's hard to say what new products or services will come next from this. It's also difficult to see any meaningful effect on the company's financials. For Apple, this means being able to sell more devices and simultaneously grow the services segment. According to Wall Street consensus analyst estimates, Apple's revenue will rise 6.3% in fiscal 2025 and 4.8% in fiscal 2026. Making accurate predictions is hard It can be a valuable exercise for investors to understand the current situation that a business is in, as well as what the near future might hold. However, making correct predictions about the direction of a stock is almost impossible to do. There are so many variables at play. For what it's worth, the consensus price target for Apple shares is $233.61, which implies 10.9% upside from today's price. That would certainly be an improvement from the last 12 months' performance. It's a gain that I wouldn't be surprised by. But investors looking at Apple shouldn't make a decision based on what could happen over the next 12 months. Instead, it's worth assessing whether or not this is a business that you'd want to own for the next five years. That's the proper way to invest, with a long-term mindset. Right now, Apple stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 31.9. That's a high valuation to pay for a company whose growth is harder to come by these days. To be fair, Apple possesses one of the world's strongest brands, its products and services are hugely in demand, and its profitability is incredible. However, I don't believe investors who own this stock will achieve market-beating returns between now and 2030, regardless of what happens in the next year.

According to a senior administration official, this financial commitment will be in addition to plans of $500 billion in U.S. investments the tech behemoth revealed in February. More News from Barchart - Supermicro’s Earnings Selloff Explained: Should You Buy SMCI Stock Now? - Palantir's Free Cash Flow Margins and Forecasts Rise - Where This Leaves PLTR Stock - Can SoundHound's Q2 Results Send the Stock Soaring on August 7? Apple stock has been in a sharp uptrend over the past four months. However, at the time of writing, it’s still down more than 10% versus the start of this year (2025). Is It a Positive for Apple Stock? A commitment to domestic manufacturing could prove a material tailwind for AAPL stock over the long term as it may shield the company from escalating tariffs that have already cost it some $800 million. Additionally, the expected financial commitment will fit right into the administration’s priorities, improving Apple’s political positioning and reducing regulatory risk for the years ahead. Simply put, Apple shares are extending gains at writing on Wednesday since the teased $100 billion pledge could enhance the company’s supply chain resilience, and support its long-term growth. AI Remains a Tailwind for AAPL Shares Daiwa analysts also view Apple’s commitment to U.S. manufacturing as a reason to load up on its stock. On Wednesday, the investment firm reiterated its “Outperform” rating on AAPL shares, expressing confidence that artificial intelligence (AI) will drive the company’s future growth. “Eventually, we see a multi-year phone and PC upgrade cycle and the shares as a core holding,” it told clients in a research note today. Daiwa currently has a $230 price target on Apple stock, which indicates potential for another 7% upside from here. Apple Hasn’t Fallen Out of Favor With Wall Street Analysts Investors should also note that Daiwa is among Wall Street firms with a more conservative view on Apple stock. According to Barchart, the consensus rating on AAPL shares currently sits at “Moderate Buy” with the mean target of an even higher $235 indicating potential upside of roughly 10% from current levels.

September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) rose +1.58%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) rose +1.96%. Stock indexes rallied sharply on Monday as they recovered from some of last Friday's steep losses. Recent stellar earnings results boosted Magnificent Seven technology stocks and semiconductor chip makers, supporting gains in the broader market. Stocks also have support from speculation that last Friday's dismal payroll and ISM manufacturing reports will prompt the Fed to cut interest rates. The chances of a Fed rate cut at the September FOMC meeting rose to 90% from 40% before the reports were released. Monday's US economic news was mixed for stocks. US June factory orders fell -4.8% m/m, right on expectations and the biggest decline in more than 5 years. However, June factory orders ex-transportation rose +0.4% m/m, stronger than the expectations of +0.3% m/m and the largest increase in 7 months. In the latest tariff news, President Trump said Monday that he would be ""substantially raising"" the tariff on US imports from India from the current 25% due to India's purchases of Russian oil. Last Thursday, President Trump raised tariffs on some Canadian goods to 35% from 25% and announced a 10% global minimum, along with tariffs of 15% or higher for countries with trade surpluses with the US, effective after midnight on August 7. According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced. The markets this week will focus on earnings reports and any fresh tariff or trade news. On Tuesday, the June trade deficit is expected to narrow to -$61.1 billion from -$71.5 billion in May. Also on Tuesday, the July ISM services index is expected to climb by +0.7 to 51.5. On Thursday, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to increase by +3,000 to 221,000. Also on Thursday, Q2 nonfarm productivity is expected to be +2.0% with unit labor costs rising +1.5%. Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 90% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting and 70% at the following meeting on October 28-29. Q2 earnings reports released thus far suggest that S&P 500 earnings are on track to rise +9.1% for the second quarter, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With over 66% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, around 82% exceeded profit estimates. Overseas stock markets on Monday settled mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 closed up sharply by +1.49%. China's Shanghai Composite rebounded from a 2-week low and closed up +0.66%. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 fell to a 1.5-week low and closed down -1.25%. Interest Rates September 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) Monday closed up +5.5 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield fell -2.4 bp to 4.192%. Sep T-notes on Monday recovered from overnight losses and rallied to a 3-month nearest-futures high, and the 10-year T-note yield fell to a 1-month low of 4.192%. T-notes have positive carryover support from last Friday's weaker-than-expected payroll and ISM manufacturing reports, which boosted the chance of a Fed rate cut at next month's FOMC meeting to 90% from 40% before the reports. Also, Monday's -1% drop in WTI crude oil prices reduced inflation expectations, a bullish factor for T-notes. In addition, Monday's strength in European government bonds provided carryover support to T-notes. Gains in T-notes were limited by a sharp rebound in equity markets, which curbed safe-haven demand for government securities. Also, supply pressures are weighing on T-notes as the Treasury will auction $125 billion of T-notes and T-bonds in this week's August quarterly refunding, beginning with Tuesday's $58 billion auction of 3-year T-notes. European government bond yields on Monday moved lower. The 10-year German bund yield fell to a 1.5-week low of 2.624% and finished down -5.4 bp to 2.624%. The 10-year UK gilt yield dropped to a 1-month low of 4.501% and finished down -1.9 bp to 4.509%. The Eurozone Aug Sentix investor confidence index unexpectedly fell -8.2 to -3.7, weaker than expectations of an increase to 6.9. Swaps are discounting the chances at 15% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting. US Stock Movers Strength in the Magnificent Seven technology stocks supported gains in the broader market. Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Meta Platforms (META) closed up more than +3%. Also, Microsoft (MSFT) and Tesla (TSLA) closed up more than +2%. In addition, Apple (AAPL) closed up +0.48%. Chip stocks rallied on Monday, a supportive factor for the overall market. Broadcom (AVGO) and KLA Corp (KLAC) closed up more than +3%. Also, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Micron Technology (MU), Marvell Technology (MRVL), and Lam Research (LRCX) closed up more than +2%. In addition, ARM Holdings Plc (ARM), Applied Materials (AMAT), and ASML Holding NV (ASML) closed up more than +1%. Steelcase (SCS) closed up more than +60% after being acquired by HNI for $2.2 billion or about $18.30 per share. Idexx Labs (IDXX) closed up more than +27% to lead gainers in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 after reporting Q2 revenue of $1.11 billion, better than the consensus of $1.07 billion, and raising its full-year EPS forecast to $12.40-$12.76 from a previous forecast of $11.93-$12.43, stronger than the consensus of $12.21. Wayfair (W) closed up more than +11% after reporting Q2 adjusted EPS of 87 cents, well above the consensus of 33 cents. Spotify (SPOT) closed up more than +5% after it said it will increase the monthly cost of premium subscriptions in Markets across South Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Europe, and Latin America. Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) closed up more than +3% after raising its full-year adjusted Ebitda forecast to $2.30 billion from a previous forecast of $2.15 billion-$2.45 billion, stronger than the consensus of $2.27 billion. Tyson Foods (TSN) closed up more than +2% after reporting Q3 sales of $13.88 billion, above the consensus of $13.55 billion. ON Semiconductor (ON) closed down more than -16% to lead losers in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 after forecasting Q3 adjusted gross margin of 36.5% to 38.5%, the midpoint weaker than the consensus of 37.7%. Bruker Corp (BRKR) closed down more than -8% after reporting Q2 revenue of $797.4 million, below the consensus of $810.2 million. LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB) closed down more than -4% after reporting Q2 adjusted Ebitda of $715 million, weaker than the consensus of $743.9 million.

September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) are up +1.15%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) are up +1.40%. Stock indexes are moving sharply higher today as they recover from some of last Friday’s steep losses. Strength in the Magnificent Seven technology stocks and semiconductor chip makers is supporting the broader market. Additionally, the expectation that last Friday’s dismal payroll and ISM manufacturing reports will prompt the Fed to lower interest rates is underpinning equity prices. The chances of a Fed rate cut at the September FOMC meeting rose to 90% from 40% before the reports were released. Today’s US economic news was mixed for stocks. US June factory orders fell -4.8% m/m, right on expectations and the biggest decline in more than 5 years. However, June factory orders ex-transportation rose +0.4% m/m, stronger than the expectations of +0.3% m/m and the largest increase in 7 months. In the latest tariff news, President Trump last Thursday raised tariffs on some Canadian goods to 35% from 25% and announced a 10% global minimum, along with tariffs of 15% or higher for countries with trade surpluses with the US, effective after midnight on August 7. According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced. The markets this week will focus on earnings reports and any fresh tariff or trade news. On Tuesday, the June trade deficit is expected to narrow to -$61.1 billion from -$71.5 billion in May. Also on Tuesday, the July ISM services index is expected to climb by +0.7 to 51.5. On Thursday, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to increase by +3,000 to 221,000. Also on Thursday, Q2 nonfarm productivity is expected to be +2.0% with unit labor costs rising +1.5%. Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 90% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting and 76% at the following meeting on October 28-29. Q2 earnings reports released thus far suggest that S&P 500 earnings are on track to rise +4.5% for the second quarter, better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With over 66% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, around 82% exceeded profit estimates. Overseas stock markets today are mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 is up sharply by +1.30%. China’s Shanghai Composite rebounded from a 2-week low and closed up +0.66%. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 fell to a 1.5-week low and closed down -1.25%. Interest Rates September 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) today are up +1 tick. The 10-year T-note yield is down -0.4 bp to 4.212%. Sep T-notes today recovered from overnight losses and rallied to a 3-month nearest-futures high, and the 10-year T-note yield fell to a 1-month low of 4.196%. T-notes have positive carryover support from last Friday’s weaker-than-expected payroll and ISM manufacturing reports, which boosted the chance of a Fed rate cut at next month’s FOMC meeting to 90% from 40% before the reports. Also, today’s -1% drop in WTI crude oil prices has reduced inflation expectations, a bullish factor for T-notes. In addition, today’s strength in European government bonds is providing carryover support to T-notes. Gains in T-notes are limited by a rebound in equity markets, which curbs safe-haven demand for government securities. Also, supply pressures are weighing on T-notes as the Treasury will auction $125 billion of T-notes and T-bonds in this week’s August quarterly refunding, beginning with Tuesday’s $58 billion auction of 3-year T-notes. European government bond yields today are moving lower. The 10-year German bund yield fell to a 1.5-week low of 2.627% and is down -4.7 bp to 2.632%. The 10-year UK gilt yield dropped to a 1-month low of 4.501% and is down -2.2 bp to 4.506%. The Eurozone Aug Sentix investor confidence index unexpectedly fell -8.2 to -3.7, weaker than expectations of an increase to 6.9. Swaps are discounting the chances at 16% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.

On July 28, Bernstein SocGen Group analyst Stacy Rasgon reiterated an “Outperform” rating on the stock with a $185.00 price target. The firm believes that QCOM is “heavily out of favor” due to general smartphone market weakness, tariff concerns, and near-term earnings challenges related to Apple rolloffs. “Qualcomm remains heavily out of favor amid general distaste of smartphones, tariff concerns, near-term muted numbers (AAPL rolloff etc). And we get it, with concerns over (similar to other markets) tariff-related pullfoward, AAPL declines about to kick off muting earnings growth over the next several years, a likely general lack of near-term visibly from management especially with 232 tariffs coming soon (likely sometime in the next few weeks so we shall see how they guide with them on the way) and a general lack of catalysts for now."" A financial analyst studying data on a computer screen, looking for signals in the market. However, the firm believes there is value under the surface. ""And yet, we still believe there is value to be had under the surface, with an objectively strong product portfolio and an adjacency story that looks increasing real (with option value to boot) that should become more and more obvious as AAPL winds out of the numbers over time. Perhaps there is no rush to get involved (yet) but valuation reflects this with the stock at a >40% discount to the S&P and a 50% discount to the SOX); ex-AAPL we believe the company could grow earnings double-digits (for which you are paying only ~15-16x); Catalyst or not, it seems a worthwhile name to keep on your back burner at least. Outperform, $185 PT.” QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) develops wireless technologies, supplies chips for mobile, automotive, and IoT, licenses patents, and invests in emerging tech.

Apple (AAPL) is scheduled to report fiscal third-quarter results after the closing bell Thursday, with analysts are largely bullish on the iPhone maker's stock despite lingering tariff questions. Of the 12 analysts covering Apple stock tracked by Visible Alpha, nine have a buy or equivalent rating, alongside two hold ratings and one sell. The consensus price target near $233 implies 9% upside over the stock’s intraday price near $215. Goldman Sachs, which has a bullish $251 target on Apple stock, said ""[s]ervices revenue growth should be resilient"" and that new AI features, like live translation across Messages, Phone, and FaceTime expected this fall, will lift demand for iPhone upgrades. The Street expects Apple's June quarter revenue to have grown 4% year-over-year to $89.34 billion, including $40.23 billion in iPhone sales (2% growth) and $26.82 billion in services revenue (11% growth). That said, Apple needs to ""get past key overhangs,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said last week. The bank cautioned that the Trump administration could soon subject Apple to Section 232 tariffs, which are tied to national security concerns and have held up better in court than country-specific duties. Morgan Stanley maintained a buy rating and $235 price target, putting it slightly above the analyst consensus. HSBC, meanwhile, kept a hold rating and $220 target, pointing to the same regulatory uncertainty in a recent note to clients. Investors will be also watching for any progress on—or increased investment in—Apple Intelligence, which has been dogged by Siri delays and a lack of availability in China. However, while Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) raised its projected capital expenditures to $85 billion from $75 billion last week, Morgan Stanley said it doesn't expect a similar move from Apple.

Before a company reports earnings, implied volatility is usually high because the market is unsure about the outcome of the report. Speculators and hedgers create huge demand for the company’s options which increases the implied volatility, and therefore, the price of options. More News from Barchart - Alphabet Posts Lower Free Cash Flow and FCF Margins - Is GOOGL Stock Overvalued? - Tech Earnings, Tariff Deadline and Other Key Things to Watch this Week After the earnings announcement, implied volatility usually drops back down to normal levels. Let’s take a look at the expected range for these stocks. To calculate the expected range, look up the option chain and add together the price of the at-the-money put option and the at-the-money call option. Use the first expiry date after the earnings date. While this approach is not as accurate as a detailed calculation, it does serve as a reasonably accurate estimate. Monday Nothing of note Tuesday UNH – 7.9% MRK – 5.1% PYPL – 7.3% BA – 4.7% SBUX – 6.8% UPS – 6.7% V – 3.5% PG – 3.2% SPOT – 9.8% RCL – 6.0% Wednesday HOOD – 9.4% META – 6.1% MSFT – 4.2% VRT – 9.6% CVNA – 13.7% ARM – 9.9% F – 6.8% QCOM – 6.2% Thursday AAPL – 4.1% MSTR – 5.5% AMZN – 5.3% COIN – 7.8% RBLX – 12.9% BMY – 5.1% NET – 12.4% ABBV – 4.3% KKR – 4.6% MA – 3.5% Friday CVX – 2.7% XOM – 2.8% CL – 3.6% Option traders can use these expected moves to structure trades. Bearish traders can look at selling bear call spreads outside the expected range. Bullish traders can sell bull put spreads outside the expected range, or look at naked puts for those with a higher risk tolerance. Neutral traders can look at iron condors. When trading iron condors over earnings, it is best to keep the short strikes outside the expected range. When trading options over earnings, it is best to stick to risk defined strategies and keep position size small. If the stock makes a larger than expected move and the trade suffers a full loss, it should not have more than a 1-3% effect on your portfolio.

Most people agree that valuations have reached alarmingly high levels. Yet, the market is still moving higher, largely led by the same growthy tech stocks that have been leading it for some time now. Many investors are shrugging off their steep valuations and diving into this aging rally's biggest winners anyway, motivated by the fear of missing out on any continued gains. Savvy investors, however, know this plan comes with too much risk and not enough reward. The smart money is rightfully looking for blue chip prospects outside of the artificial intelligence (AI)-driven mania that may have underperformed of late, but offer greater long-term upside. And in some cases, this upside is likely to begin materializing in the latter half of this year, once the market comes to grips with the fact that not all of the recent winners deserve to hold on to their big gains. To this end, here's a closer look at three Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks that you might want to consider stepping into specifically because they're not caught up in the bullish mania. 1. Apple It's true. iPhone maker Apple (AAPL 2.04%) botched its chance to make a big splash on the consumer-facing artificial intelligence scene. Its highly touted Apple Intelligence platform that launched in October was introduced without several features its loyal customers were expecting, for instance. And the tech is only available to owners of its very newest iPhones anyway -- the iPhone 15 and earlier (which is the vast majority of its actively used base of devices) can't actually run Apple Intelligence. Meanwhile, the updated version of Apple's digital assistant Siri has proven to be a flop, resulting in a major management shakeup and a ""back to the drawing board"" decision that means Siri's intended big leap won't be ready for relaunch until early next year.This very un-Apple-esque saga is the chief reason Apple shares have struggled since late last year. One of the most interesting aspects of investing, however, is that stocks are backward-looking right up until they're forward-looking again, and start reflecting the likely future rather than the recent past. Given Apple's acknowledgement of its AI misfires and the company's efforts to fix them, there's every reason to hope that what was supposed to happen this year is still going to happen. It's just going to happen next year. That's the contrarian argument from Fundstrat Capital analyst Tom Lee. While he acknowledges Apple's current challenges, in a recent interview with CNBC, he also said of the company's artificial intelligence developmental efforts, ""For me, Apple has been sort of quietly ready to pounce on AI... So, I think Apple is going to surprise people."" A little more time will also allow for the release of another wave of iPhones capable of handling the onboard AI duties that Apple Intelligence requires. And the crowd seems to be slowly coming around to Lee's way of thinking. The stock's relatively slow, measured recovery from April's low appears to be picking up steam as Apple's AI work moves into clearer view. Yet, there's plenty of room for shares to continue marching higher even before revisiting December's peak. 2. Walmart Walmart (WMT 1.26%) shares served up a rock star performance in 2024, rallying more than 70% during the 12-month stretch on progress that most investors didn't seem to expect. But there's been little follow-up. The stock's barely above where it ended last year, and has merely moved sideways since May. The market appears to just be waiting for the next catalytic headline. That may ultimately be a mistake, however. See, the time to step into a stock isn't when everybody is buying it in the midst of a news-driven rally. The time to step in is in the calm before the storm, on faith that the bullish news is coming. And it's certainly not like there's reason to believe Walmart won't be providing these catalysts. Take its fiscal first quarter's results as an example. Despite the lethargic economy (domestic as well as global), Walmart managed respectable top-line growth of 2.5%, or sales growth of 4.4% on a constant-currency basis. Meanwhile, same-store sales within the U.S. improved to the tune of 4.5% year over year, while operating income grew 3%. These aren't huge numbers. But, for the world's biggest retailer that's limited by its sheer size in an environment that's also been rattled by tariffs, this is solid growth. The thing is, it's not just the retailer's most basic results that investors will likely appreciate when other companies from other industries start running into cyclical and valuation headwinds in the foreseeable future. The market's just as likely -- if not more likely -- to latch onto one of the other impressive metrics Walmart is now regularly reporting. Take Walmart.com's advertising business as an example. After growing 27% to $4.4 billion last year, it soared by double-digits again in Q1. The company's e-commerce arm also experienced 22% worldwide growth during the first quarter, boosted by deliveries to the growing number of Walmart+ subscribers. The point is, in an environment that's supposed to be tough, Walmart is making it look pretty easy. The market should start seeing and rewarding this again soon enough. 3. Johnson & Johnson Finally, add Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 0.60%) to your list of Dow Jones stocks that could soar in 2025 and beyond. J&J was, of course, one of the market's hottest stocks during and because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Its Jcovden vaccine was one of the few that could be made ready en masse quickly enough to matter, driving more than $2 billion worth of revenue in 2021 -- a feat almost repeated in 2022 before the need for the vaccine effectively ended in 2023. In retrospect, though, the scope of the pandemic-prompted rally never quite made sense. Jcovden was never a major breadwinner. Meanwhile, to the extent the pharmaceutical giant needed something to offset the coronavirus vaccine's waning revenue as well as Remicade's, Simponi's, and blood-cancer-fighting Imbruvica's slight-but-persistent sales declines, it just didn't have it. That's why Johnson & Johnson shares have been more misses than hits since 2022. There's a reason, however, this pharmaceutical stock is finally starting to make higher highs and higher lows again. That is, there's hope on the horizon. In simplest terms, Johnson & Johnson is going all-in on the oncology front. It's not only invested a great deal of money in developing its own cancer drugs, but has spent billions to acquire promising cancer-fighting prospects like Ambrx Biopharma's ARX517, an antibody drug conjugate (or ADC) aimed at prostate cancer. Johnson & Johnson is looking to build a deep and wide portfolio of ADC cancer drugs, in fact, with its senior director of oncology innovation, Stefan Hart, plainly stating late last year, ""J&J's growing pipeline of ADC therapeutics and external collaboration efforts reflect our investment and confidence in the future of the ADC space."" And investors may not have to wait much longer to see the fruits of this labor and investment, either. The company contends its oncology business will be worth $50 billion per year by 2030, versus last year's cancer-related revenue of just over $20 billion and its total top line of just under $90 billion. JNJ stock will of course reward progress made toward this goal in the meantime."

On August 8, Melius analyst Ben Reitzes raised the price target on the stock to $260.00 (from $240.00) while maintaining a Buy rating. The firm is optimistic about the upcoming iPhone product cycles. It also believes that Siri AI concerns are overblown. “Apple’s stock has reacted nicely to tariff news, but we see focus starting to move toward new products and systematic increases in value for iPhones that drives growth for the next 3+ years. We raise our FY26 EPS estimate 12 cents due to higher gross margins and modestly raise FY27 EPS. Our target adjusts to $260, and we think concerns about the Siri delay are overblown since Apple isn’t losing share. Reiterate Buy.” Melius is optimistic that a new iPhone product cycle starting in September will likely improve product mix. This will in turn boost growth in high single digits during some quarters. “We are optimistic that our iPhone estimates can be conservative based on new product cycles that include an “iPhone Air” this September, a foldable model in FY26 and the iPhone 20 line-up in late FY27 (20th year anniversary models). Luckily for Apple, its iPhone base doesn’t seem to care about the Siri/AI delays, and we see no evidence of real switching.” With more iPhone catalysts, expensive models such as foldables will likely help increase total revenue. “The iPhone has more catalysts in 2026 with the introduction of a foldable model that should be priced around $2,000 and then the iPhone 20 (“20th anniversary”) cycle in 2027. As foldables “mix in” there can be big revenue growth even on flat units.” Apple is a technology company known for its consumer electronics, software, and services.

Analysts are more optimistic that the company has squashed some of the tariff drama with President Donald Trump's administration. Investing $600 billion in America will pay off for shareholders Many large tech companies have been in the crosshairs of the Trump administration, which seeks to bring more manufacturing back to the U.S. Trump recently announced that he would slap a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports unless companies are building or investing in the U.S. Earlier this week, Apple, which is one of the hardest-hit large tech companies by tariffs, announced a $600 billion U.S. investment. While it sounds costly, it's the better alternative to higher tariffs, Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes wrote in a note today. Reitzes also reiterated a buy rating on the stock and raised his price target by $20 to $260. ""It relieves Apple from paying incremental tariffs on U.S.-bound iPhones from India,"" Reitzes said, adding that a stronger iPhone production cycle could begin in the fall. ""We are going to take a risk here and raise our target and our numbers, taking out a huge portion of our tariff hits."" One problem potentially solved Apple's stock has struggled this year because of how much of the company's production is abroad in China, India, and Vietnam. Even after the big run this week, shares are still down about 5.5% on the year. The company has also struggled to convince investors that it has a strong road map in place for artificial intelligence. While that challenge remains, removing some of the tariff overhang is certainly a big step in the right direction and allows the company to focus more on its core business."

Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook made it clear that Apple is growing its AI investments, both in infrastructure and personnel, and multiple analysts raised their price target following the iPhone maker's quarterly results. JPMorgan analysts called out Cook’s “aggressive tone on investments to catch up and support Al competitiveness.” On Apple’s earnings call, Cook said the iPhone maker is ramping up its investments and reallocating employees to focus on AI. The bank maintained an “overweight” rating and raised its price target to $255 from $250, suggesting 22% upside with Apple stock down 2% Friday at about $204. Whether it reaches that target could depend on features like an AI-enhanced Siri, which Cook confirmed is coming in 2026, after extensive delays. Citi raised its target to $240 from $235, noting that growing AI spending, including a potential acquisition in the sector, could position Apple for a strong iPhone cycle in 2026. Cook said on the earnings call Apple would consider buying other companies to raise its AI capabilities—something Wall Street analysts have suggested could give Apple’s AI efforts a bigger boost. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, a longtime Apple bull, last month suggested AI startup Perplexity may be a target. And according to reports, Apple had discussions with Claude developer Anthropic and ChatGPT maker OpenAI about utilizing their models versus using in-house options. Jefferies meanwhile raised its price target to about $191, which still implies downside to Apple’s current share price. The broker maintained a “hold” rating, adding, it's “hard to get excited,” at the company’s current valuation. UBS similarly kept a “neutral” rating and raised its target to $220 from $210.

The market is reading the news as part of INTC’s broader commitment to regain relevance in the global semiconductor industry. More News from Barchart - Intel Stock Soars Along With Unusual Put Options Activity - Is INTC Stock Overvalued? - Looking for the Next Big Pop? Here’s Why Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX) Could Do a Dead-Cat Bounce Intel stock has been in a sharp uptrend ever since it secured a multibillion-dollar deal with the U.S. government. Last week, Nvidia (NVDA) threw it a $5 billion lifeline as well. At the time of writing, INTC shares are up nearly 90% versus their August low. Why Apple Investment May Not Be the Lifeline Intel Stock Needs Apple’s involvement will likely prove a symbolic win for INTC stock, but it may not be the operational lifeline bulls are hoping for. What Intel so desperately needs at the moment is a major customer for its foundry business, and there’s no indication so far that a potential deal with AAPL will include a foundry deal. After all, Nvidia’s investment did not include that part of the company’s business either. Even with Apple’s backing, therefore, Intel may continue to face delays in advanced node delivery; its foundry unit may remain a laggard to Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Samsung. An investment from the iPhone maker, if it materializes, will be more strategic than transformative. In short, capital alone is hardly a fix for Intel’s core challenges. Without a clear roadmap to volume production and customer wins, the enthusiasm my fade quickly. Where Options Pricing Suggests INTC Shares Are Headed According to options data from Barchart, contracts with expiration date set at Dec. 19 signal Intel shares will trade within the range of $26.77 and $39.69 over the next few months. In the near term, the expected move through the end of next week is 7.11%, with the upper price pegged at $35.59. However, the overall sustainability of INTC gains hinges on it securing a major foundry customer. Without one, the downside is much more likely to play out. For meaningful recovery, the semiconductor stock needs more than headlines. It needs execution, customers, and technological leadership. Wall Street Sees Significant Downside in Intel Wall Street analysts also believe the rally in Intel stock since early August is largely overdone."

In the 20th century, it was oil. In the early 2000s, it was the internet. And today, it’s artificial intelligence. And America is rapidly becoming the hub of the global AI revolution. From chipmakers to data centers to software leaders, the pieces are falling into place for one of the largest industrial buildouts in U.S. history. These aren’t just ideas anymore; they’re rising on U.S. soil. So, the question isn’t if this boom takes off – it’s whether you’ll be positioned before it does. As investors, the challenge is not to be distracted by daily turbulence, but to focus on where the real, long-term value is being created. So, my InvestorPlace colleague Luke Lango is joining us today to share how that value is being laid brick by brick in the foundation of the American AI boom. Take it away, Luke… It feels like markets are walking a tightrope. Wars drag on in Ukraine and the Middle East. Energy prices lurch higher on supply shocks. Washington flirts with a debt crisis while Beijing tests the limits of U.S. resolve. Every headline seems designed to shake confidence. And yet, beneath the turbulence, a quieter story is unfolding… The American AI Boom has begun. While politicians posture and stock prices oscillate, the most important companies in the world are making some of the biggest bets in modern economic history – not overseas but right here in the U.S. Even amid emerging crises, the AI Boom remains unfazed. Chips are shipping in record volumes. Data centers are rising from Texas to Virginia. Utilities are racing to rewire the grid. Corporations and governmental departments alike are deploying AI agents at breakneck speed. Geopolitics threatens the market’s balance, but AI is tilting the future in a different direction. That divergence hides an opportunity most investors aren’t seeing – yet… Why Nvidia Is Pouring $500 Billion Into U.S. AI Infrastructure Let’s start with the kingmaker: Nvidia (NVDA), arguably the most important company in AI today. The firm announced plans to invest up to $500 billion into American AI infrastructure over the next four years. That’s half a trillion dollars. And it’s already happening. - Production of Nvidia’s latest chip, the Blackwell, has officially begun in Phoenix, Ariz., at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSM) new U.S. plant. That’s right; TSM, Taiwan’s silicon giant, is making its crown jewel chip for Nvidia on American soil. - Nvidia is also building supercomputer manufacturing facilities in Texas through partnerships with Foxconn (FXCOF) and Wistron. That marks the first time ever Nvidia will make these machines in the U.S. - Plus, it’s teaming up with Amkor Technology (AMKR) and Siliconware Precision Industries to develop packaging and testing operations, all based in Arizona. Nvidia has decided that the future of AI infrastructure is American. And it’s not the only one… Big Tech Joins the American AI Boom Nvidia may be the headliner, but the chorus of companies backing the American AI Boom is loud – and growing louder by the day. - Apple (AAPL) recently pledged to invest $500 billion in the U.S. over the coming years, including the construction of a massive AI server facility in Houston, expected to open in 2026. - Meta (META) is pumping $10 billion into its largest-ever data center campus in northeast Louisiana, exclusively dedicated to AI development. - Microsoft (MSFT) just tripled its original proposal, announcing a $3.3 billion investment to build an AI superhub in southeast Wisconsin. - OpenAI, Oracle (ORCL), SoftBank (SFTBY), and others have teamed up under the White House’s Project Stargate, pledging to invest up to $500 billion into AI infrastructure and innovation hubs across the U.S. This is more than a boom. It’s an explosion. AI Reshoring Is Now a National Security Priority Why the sudden rush to reindustrialize America’s tech backbone? Because this year’s trade war has exposed the fragility of globalization. With tariffs hampering imports and geopolitical tensions simmering, Big Tech is de-risking its supply chains. And the best way to do that is to build at home. But it’s not just about economics anymore. It’s about national security. AI is not consigned to boosting efficiency in the office or creating artwork on a dime. It’s becoming the backbone of 21st-century power – military, economic, technological, and cultural. Just consider Palantir (PLTR). As Bloomberg reported, “the firm’s artificial intelligence and analysis tech gathers data from third-party sensors and systems, including satellites. The tools then distill the information, giving soldiers more awareness of their surroundings and helping them hit targets faster and more accurately.” Control over AI infrastructure means control over future prosperity. The White House knows it. So does Nvidia, Microsoft, and every other company racing to erect fabs and data centers across the American heartland. What began as a tariff tantrum may very well end in the largest technological buildout on U.S. soil since the interstate highway system. AI Stocks to Watch as the U.S. Industrial AI Renaissance Accelerates While the headlines warn about destruction, the groundwork is still being laid for creation. And in times like these, seasoned investors often turn to a time-tested principle: stay level-headed when fear dominates the headlines. Amid uncertainty, opportunities can emerge for those who remain focused on long-term trends. The intensifying Russia-Ukraine war has created fear. Tariffs have created pain. But through that fog, the signal is clear: Capital is coming home. Infrastructure is being built. AI is going domestic. That’s rocket fuel for an American AI Boom. So, what’s the move? You don’t need to chase every bounce or time every dip. Instead, what you shouldbe doing is building your AI stock watchlist and looking for entry points as fear creates opportunity. Focus on: - Semiconductor leaders reshoring U.S. production (think NVDA, AMD, TSM partners). - AI software companies (like PLTR, AXON, META, MSFT). - Advanced manufacturing plays in packaging, testing, and thermal systems (such as SNPS, COHR, AMAT). For investors watching AI stocks closely, this reshoring wave signals a potential multi-year uptrend This is the dawn of the Fourth Industrial Revolution; and it’s being built on American soil. America Is Quietly Building the Future of AI. Are You In? Tariffs, inflation, war, political unrest, increasingly devastating natural disasters… Trust us when we say that we understand why a lot of people are afraid right now. But even amid the chaos, there’s an important picture coming into focus here. If markets can hold steady through this level of turmoil, imagine the strength they could show in recovery. The time to start buying AI is not when the news gets better. It’s right now – while the future is being built, brick by brick, right here at home. And we believe the best AI stocks to buy right now are those directly enabling this American AI Boom… Not through data centers or chip fabs but, rather, through a critical piece of technology that will soon be ubiquitous because of them. Behind the scenes, these innovations are quietly laying the foundation for something even more profound: humanoid robotics. Think warehouse robots that learn on the fly, medical assistants that adapt in real time, or domestic helpers that move, see, and reason like humans do. Many expect these machines to take the world by storm over the next few years, transforming life as we know it – as well as the entire global labor market… Advanced robotics technology could power an entirely new economy built on intelligent machines. And the companies building that backbone may be the biggest winners of all. Regards, Luke Lango Editor, Hypergrowth Investing"

A newly finalized trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union is poised to significantly benefit U.S.-based LNG exporters, the Magnificent 7 technology giants, and the broader tech sector, according to market experts. What Happened: The deal, announced ahead of the Aug. 1 deadline, is seen as removing a key layer of uncertainty that had hung over the markets. Louis Navellier, founder and chief investment officer of Navellier & Associates, told Benzinga that LNG exporters such as Dorian LPG Ltd. as likely winners. He noted that “the analyst community is revising their earnings estimates higher” for these companies. Trending: 7,000+ investors have joined Timeplast's mission to eliminate microplastics—now it's your turn to invest in the future of sustainable plastic before time runs out. The trade deal includes the EU's commitment to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy over three years and invest another $600 billion in the U.S. economy. Navellier also pointed to the “Magnificent 7 and other big U.S. technology companies” as beneficiaries, anticipating that “the EU is expected to be more reluctant to hit them with digital taxes” under the Donald Trump Administration. The agreement’s impact extends to the overall U.S. stock market. Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management, told Benzinga that he views the deal as “good for US markets as it removes some of the uncertainty that was an overhang for the market, and at a 15% rate, it is lower than what was originally feared.” Zaccarelli reiterated the positive outlook for technology and emphasized the energy sector, stating it “will be an even bigger beneficiary because of the intent of the EU to buy more energy from the United States as a result of the new trade deal.” While the deal brings clarity, some of the positive news may have already been factored into stock prices. Zaccarelli noted, “news of this deal being ‘close’ was released last week and some of the good news was likely already reflected in prices before today's official announcement.” Here’s a list of the energy and technology sector beneficiaries highlighted by experts; See Also: This AI-Powered Trading Platform Has 5,000+ Users, 27 Pending Patents, and a $43.97M Valuation — You Can Become an Investor for Just $500.25 Why It Matters: Looking ahead, experts believe the Aug. 1 deadline is largely being adhered to, providing further market certainty."

They unenthusiastically traded the company's stock that session, weakly pushing it only 0.5% higher. Meanwhile, the benchmark S&P 500 index closed the day 1.5% in positive territory. Barclays is quite the bear In its new Apple take, Barclays reiterated its existing underweight (read: sell) recommendation on the iDevice maker. This, despite enacting a slight raise in its price target to $180 per share from the preceding $173. According to reports, Barclays' continued pessimistic outlook on Apple stems from three key factors. The first is the inherent weakness in the company's foundational hardware business. Growth in such products has been modest, and the bank's analysts pointed out that the seemingly robust growth in the company's just-reported fiscal third quarter was due to factors such as forward purchasing ahead of anticipated tariffs. The second is China, a crucial market for Apple. Barclays believes that intensifying competition will threaten the company's market share in the sprawling Asian nation. Concerned about regulators Finally, the bank is wary about potential regulatory difficulties Apple might have in its Apple Services segment. With increased scrutiny and regulatory action around app marketplaces like the App Store, the company could be hit with rulings that reduce its take from this lucrative revenue stream. Last week, Alphabet's Google suffered a notable legal defeat when its appeal against an unfavorable ruling in a case centered around its Google Play was rejected. Both regulators and courts seem to find the highly advantageous conditions of marketplaces like Google Play and the App Store distasteful."

September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) rose +0.72%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) rose +1.21%. Stock indexes rallied Wednesday on some positive corporate news. Arista Networks closed up more than +17% after its Q3 revenue forecast exceeded expectations. Also, Match Group closed up more than +10% after projecting a stronger-than-expected Q3 sales forecast. In addition, Apple rose +5% to lead megacap technology stocks higher after President Trump said the company will announce that it will commit to spending another $100 billion on domestic manufacturing. Speculation that weaker-than-expected US economic news will push the Fed to lower interest rates as soon as next month is also supporting stocks. Tuesday’s unexpected decline in US services activity added to last Friday’s weak payroll and manufacturing reports. The chances of a Fed rate cut at the September FOMC meeting rose to 95% Wednesday from 40% last Friday. Also, dovish Fed comments on Wednesday bolstered speculation about a Fed rate cut. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said, “The economy is slowing and in the near term it may become appropriate to start adjusting the federal funds rate lower.” Additionally, Fed Governor Lisa Cook said last Friday’s US July jobs report is “concerning” and that “the revisions are somewhat typical of turning points” in the US economy. The US MBA mortgage applications index rose +3.1% in the week ended August 1, with the purchase mortgage sub-index up +1.5% and the refinancing mortgage sub-index up +5.2%. The average 30-year fixed rate mortgage fell -6 bp to 6.77% from 6.83% in the prior week. In recent tariff news, President Trump announced Wednesday that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India’s purchases of Russian oil. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on semiconductor and pharmaceutical imports would be announced “within the next week or so.” Last Thursday, President Trump raised tariffs on some Canadian goods to 35% from 25% and announced a 10% global minimum, along with tariffs of 15% or higher for countries with trade surpluses with the US, effective after midnight on August 7. According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced. The markets this week will focus on earnings reports and any fresh tariff or trade news. On Thursday, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to increase by +3,000 to 221,000. Also on Thursday, Q2 nonfarm productivity is expected to be +2.0% with unit labor costs rising +1.5%. Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 95% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting and 68% at the following meeting on October 28-29. Q2 earnings reports released thus far suggest that S&P 500 earnings are on track to rise +9.1% for the second quarter, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With over 67% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, around 83% exceeded profit estimates. Overseas stock markets on Wednesday settled higher. The Euro Stoxx 50 closed up +0.26%. China’s Shanghai Composite closed up +0.45%. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +0.60%. Interest Rates September 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) on Wednesday closed down -2 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield rose +0.6 bp to 4.216%. Supply pressures weighed on T-notes as the Treasury auctioned $42 billion of 10-year T-notes Wednesday as part of this week’s $125 billion auctions of T-notes and T-bonds in the August quarterly refunding. Also, strength in stocks on Wednesday has reduced safe haven demand for T-notes. Weak demand for the Treasury’s $42 billion auction of 10-year T-notes was bearish for T-note prices as the auction had a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.35, well below the 10-auction average of 2.58. Losses in T-notes were limited due to dovish Fed comments from Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and Fed Governor Lisa Cook, who signaled their support for interest rate cuts. Also, Wednesday’s 1% fall in crude oil prices undercut inflation expectations and was supportive for T-notes. European government bond yields on Wednesday moved higher. The 10-year German bund yield rose +2.6 bp to 2.650%. The 10-year UK gilt yield rose +1.0 bp to 4.526%. Eurozone June retail sales rose +0.3% m/m, right on expectations. German June factory orders unexpectedly fell by -1.0% m/m, weaker than expectations of a +1.1% m/m increase and the biggest decline in 5 months. ECG Governing Council member Holzmann said, “In my view, there is no longer any reason for the ECB to lower interest rates further and we should wait and see what economic developments arise, particularly outside Europe, and how we respond to them.” Swaps are discounting the chances at 13% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting. US Stock Movers Astera Labs (ALAB) closed up more than +27% after reporting Q2 gross margin of 76%, better than the consensus of 74%. RingCentral (RNG) closed up more than +25% after reporting Q2 adjusted EPS of $1.06, above the consensus of $1.02, and raising its full-year adjusted EPS forecast to $4.20-$4.32 from a previous forecast of $4.13-$4.27, stronger than the consensus of $4.21.

After asking it to write a parody of My Way (presumably Frank Sinatra's, not Usher's) in Spanish, he was quite impressed. ""I think it's an incredible technological advance in terms of showing what we can do,"" Buffett said in an interview. Even so, Buffett hasn't made many direct moves to capitalize on the rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years. He remains wary of the technology and how it could be used. Nonetheless, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.70%) (BRK.B 0.78%) finds about 24% of its $300 billion in marketable equities invested in three AI stocks, including one Berkshire Hathaway just added to the portfolio. 1. Apple (23.1%) Apple (AAPL 2.04%) once accounted for more than half of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Even after selling nearly 70% of its stake since the end of 2023, the stock remains Buffett's largest marketable equity holding, valued at more than $69.4 billion. Apple has had some trouble getting its artificial intelligence efforts off the ground. After the company announced generative AI-powered features for iOS in 2024, much of that functionality has failed to materialize. Apple has reportedly pivoted to building a chatbot interface, including a web search tool like Perplexity and a fully redesigned Siri. The project will likely combine Apple's own foundation models with other large language models from a third party. Apple also made its foundation models free to use for developers, enabling them to build AI apps that keep data on the users' devices instead of pinging a third-party data center. The effort is to support an ecosystem of apps using secure AI features. Buffett hasn't been selling Apple stock due to its lagging AI efforts, though. The biggest driving force behind the sales appears to be its valuation. The stock currently trades for 31 times forward earnings estimates. For a company growing relatively slowly, that's an expensive price to pay. With the huge gains Berkshire held (and still holds) in its Apple investment, it seems like an appropriate time to take some off the table. 2. Amazon (0.7%) Amazon (AMZN -0.61%) is the biggest cloud computing provider in the world. While it was caught flat-footed as generative AI took off, it's caught up with its offerings for Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers. Amazon separates its ""AI stack"" into three layers, giving AWS customers optionality and functionality. At the bottom is its custom silicon for training and inference, which offers developers better price performance than general-purpose GPUs. At the middle is its platform called Bedrock, which is a managed service for building new AI applications. Amazon also offers its own foundation model, Nova. The top layer includes AI-powered tools for developers like Amazon Q, which provides assistance for coding projects. Management says AI services on AWS is a multibillion-dollar business growing at a triple-digit rate. Furthermore, it has more demand than supply, which should support continued growth as it spends heavily to build out new data centers. To that end, Amazon's spending over $100 billion this year on capital expenditures. Some of those expenses include Amazon's growing logistics footprint, which it overhauled a couple of years ago to improve efficiency. AI models help predict where to store items, ensuring faster shipping for more items. At the same time, the new model has reduced overall shipping costs, which has shown up in Amazon's improving operating margin for its retail business. Amazon is a relatively small position in Berkshire's portfolio, but it could deserve a much larger portion of your own. 3. Nucor (0.3%) Nucor (NUE -0.66%) pioneered the process of using electric arc furnaces, or mini-mills, to turn low-cost scrap metal into steel. Since it operates in America, it benefited from President Donald Trump's tariff policies, which placed a 50% tax on steel imports. Berkshire Hathaway picked up 6.6 million shares of Nucor stock in the second quarter. Data center infrastructure has been a huge driving force for Nucor. Management said steel shipments for data centers doubled through the first half of 2025. It cited third-party data showing spending on new data center construction will accelerate in 2026 from 18% this year to 26%. That should support continued growth in Nucor's top line as big tech builds more and more data centers to house billions worth of silicon. But since Nucor uses electricity in its mini-mills, it's seen costs climb quickly as the growing number of data centers strain the supply of electricity and have sent prices higher. Management forecasts margin compression for the third quarter, weighing on its earnings per share. Last month, management provided guidance of $2.05 to $2.15 in earnings per share for the third quarter, well below the $2.60 it reported for the second quarter. But analysts expect it's just a temporary setback, as the massive demand for data centers should propel earnings per share higher in 2026 and 2027. With the stock trading for just 12 times analysts' 2026 earnings expectations as of this writing, Nucor is a value stock with great exposure to the artificial intelligence trend."

At its heart, you'll find consumers. The money that everyday people spend on products and services represents roughly two-thirds of the country's economic output. That's why many of the world's largest companies, and the market's best-performing stocks, are consumer-facing businesses. Here are four remarkable companies that represent powerful brands, control impressive shares of their respective markets, and have long runways for growth that make them enticing stocks to buy and hold. All four stocks have soared in the past, but remain positioned to deliver outsized gains over the next 20 years. 1. Amazon The leading e-commerce company in the United States, Amazon (AMZN -0.61%), is an all-time great in the wealth-building department. It has become a multitrillion-dollar juggernaut since its IPO less than 30 years ago, and despite its size, continues to experiment and expand. Most consumers know Amazon for its online shopping marketplace, where it controls an estimated 37.6% of the e-commerce market in America. However, Amazon's empire now includes cloud computing, media, advertising, and more. Amazon's e-commerce success to date has mostly been driven by discretionary purchases; it just recently began rolling out a massive expansion of its grocery services, enabling shoppers to order food products, including perishable goods, for same-day delivery across 1,000 U.S. towns and cities. It could expand that service to 2,300 municipalities by the end of the year. E-commerce still represents less than 17% of total retail spending in the U.S., so it still has plenty of room for growth, and that's without factoring in artificial intelligence's potential impact, which could drive cloud growth and cut costs elsewhere in the company. 2. Apple The iPhone made Apple (AAPL 2.04%) one of the world's largest companies, and laid the groundwork for a sticky ecosystem that spans phones, computers, tablets, services, and accessories. Apple's brand is known worldwide, with over 2.35 billion active devices globally. Apple's prowess in consumer devices led many to expect it would be able to easily capitalize on the AI trend, but it arguably stumbled coming out of the gate in its efforts to exploit that opportunity. Nonetheless, Apple's sticky ecosystem will likely buy it time to get things right, and assuming Apple does when it revamps its Siri technology for a release next year, the company could quickly improve its standing in the AI landscape. Apple could lean further into its pricing power than it has in the past, a potentially powerful growth lever it could pull that, along with massive share repurchases, could help the company continue to churn out steady growth, dividends, and investment returns for years to come. 3. Uber Technologies Ride-hailing giant Uber Technologies (UBER -0.25%) currently faces some questions about its long-term future as competitors with autonomous vehicles like Tesla's Robotaxi and Alphabet's Waymo begin to expand to new markets. But the doubters may be getting ahead of themselves. Uber drivers engaged in 18% more trips in the second quarter of 2025 than they did in the prior-year period, across a diverse offering of ride-hailing, delivery, and transportation services. It is approaching $200 billion in annualized bookings -- a scale that none of its rivals currently approaches. Additionally, its subscription program, Uber One, has rapidly grown to 36 million members. Uber has the size and resources to plan countermeasures to the threat posed by rival services built around self-driving vehicles; those competitors won't grow large enough to threaten Uber overnight. The company is already partnering to develop its own autonomous vehicle options, too. Uber's brand name and the network effects it enjoys due to its extensive U.S. footprint won't fade easily, and make the stock a likely winner moving forward. 4. Philip Morris International Investors have long considered tobacco companies to be dinosaurs on the verge of extinction, but Philip Morris International (PM 1.35%) has shown the industry is making a comeback. While the use of traditional cigarettes has been steadily falling, the industry has evolved, shifting to smokeless nicotine products, like electronic cigarettes (vapes), heat-not-burn tobacco devices, and oral pouches filled with nicotine powder. Philip Morris was an early mover in heat-not-burn devices, and it acquired the maker of Zyn, the leading nicotine pouch brand, in early 2023. The addictive nature of nicotine has provided tobacco companies with immense pricing power, which has allowed them to offset declining cigarette sales volumes over the years by repeatedly raising their prices. Now, the surging popularity of next-generation nicotine products has reignited Philip Morris' growth. The company's revenue grew by 7.1% in the second quarter of 2025, driven by 15.2% growth in smoke-free products. That smoke-free momentum should continue well into the future, cementing solid total returns and supporting a dividend that yields 3.2% at the current share price. Moreover, management has raised its payout every year since it was spun off from Altria in 2008, and will likely keep that streak going."
1943f0a86d0c1f1cdb9f9fd52d090c0eba0955600956a6f938788cb5d0fbaf88,AAPL,Apple 10 % Stock Pop : Time to Invest in the Technology Giant Embracing America ? ,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apples-10-stock-pop-time-071200035.html,finance.yahoo.com,20250817T094500Z,semi,0.65,"Investors are back on the Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) train. The stock of the multinational technology giant is still down slightly in 2025 but popped over 10% in the last week after management announced new planned spending in the U.S. CEO Tim Cook even visited the White House in a joint press conference with President Donald Trump to announce this new planned spending on components for the iPhone as well as other Apple products in America. It has helped the company achieve some breathing room around potential tariffs on semiconductors, iPhone components, and iPhones themselves getting imported to America. Apple's stock got its mojo back on this upsized spending news, but should you actually buy shares today? Here's what the numbers say. A $600 billion investment Earlier this year, Apple announced that it would spend $500 billion over the next four years in the United States. Last week, it upped its estimate to $600 billion, or $150 billion annually. This is different than a company's announced capital expenditure plans, such as when Amazon promises $100 billion in investments related to data centers and its delivery network. Apple is spending money with its suppliers, including advanced glass screens and various semiconductor manufacturers. It is more of an announcement around committed orders for products, which will spur demand for factory work in the United States. Apple is a sprawling company, and the announced spending will occur in all 50 states, impact 450,000 jobs, and involve 79 different factories. It is astounding how complex Apple's supply chain for the iPhone and other computing hardware is today. However, Apple is still not at the point of a ""Made in America iPhone"" as assembly and other services are performed in China and India, with Apple negotiating with the U.S. government around what is feasible to bring to the United States. Investors applauded the spending plans as a way to shy away from tariff risks on iPhone and semiconductor imports, which could have added huge costs to Apple's supply chain, damaging its profits. Now, it seems to be in good standing with the U.S. government and regulation authorities again. Does the announcement matter? In regard to tariffs, this spending announcement won't necessarily hurt the company, it just prevents Apple from having future cost increases across its supply chain. However, since the U.S. has higher salaries and labor standards, this investment may lead to higher input costs for product components, which could lead to margin compression. Apple's operating margin has steadily risen since the COVID-19 pandemic, hitting a record high of 32% over the last 12 months. Sourcing components in the United States may reverse this expansion. What matters more at the end of the day is demand for Apple's products. Last quarter, the company released solid figures for the three months ending in June. Total revenue grew just under 10% year over year, driven by services revenue and iPhone revenue growth. Even though the iPhone is almost 20 years old, it remains the bread and butter of Apple's business today. This puts the company in a tough spot. Even though the iPhone remains wildly popular, unit volumes have stagnated for years, meaning Apple is only able to grow revenue by increasing prices. This is not an ideal position to be in. Price increases may be necessary just to maintain profit margins in the future if input costs grow due to the Made-in-America investments. All in all, this announcement does matter. It just might be a negative for Apple's business, contrary to the stock's initial reaction. The truth about Apple stock There are a lot of arguments to be made -- both bearish and bullish -- for Apple stock. Bulls might say this is a fantastic brand with major lock-in effects along with a growing services division with strong profit margins. Bears may say that Apple's unit volumes for the iPhone have fallen with no new successful products coming down the pipeline. For example, the Apple Vision Pro has turned into a total product bust, likely losing the company billions if not tens of billions of dollars. A deciding factor in this debate could be the stock's valuation. Apple's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is 35. This is quite expensive for a business with low revenue growth. Compare that to Alphabet, which has grown its revenue significantly faster than Apple over the last few years but trades at a more reasonable P/E ratio of 22. Apple may be a great business, but that doesn't mean you should ignore the price you pay when analyzing its stock. Avoid buying shares of Apple after this post-announcement pop.

After months of worries over how tariffs will affect costs for iPhones made in China or India, Apple just projected a $100 billion increase in its spending plans over the next four years in the United States, including an investment in homegrown semiconductors. Apple stock shot up over 10% on the news. Does this new spending plan mean you should load the boat with Apple stock? Here's the big picture that investors need to understand today. A $100 billion spending increase .... over four years Last week, Apple claimed it would spend $600 billion in the United States. This is a large number, but it's also a bit misleading compared to other recent announcements from major tech companies such as Alphabet. The parent company of Google is forecasting $85 billion of capital expenditures this year, with much of that going to artificial intelligence (AI). Meanwhile, Apple's spending is over four years. The latest increase adds $25 billion in annual spending, bringing the grand total up from $500 billion to $600 billion. What's more, this includes various expenses such as employee salaries, data center buildouts, money paid to suppliers, and more -- it's not exclusive to capital expenditures. Other big tech peers are likely spending this amount or more if you cast as wide a net Apple does when calculating total spending. The announcement may put Apple in good standing with the U.S. government, but it's not a radical change from management. The company is still doing the bulk of its manufacturing in China, and this new commitment only represents a slight deviation from its previously announced plans. Improving financial performance Financial performance and earnings power are what matter for Apple stock. Last quarter, revenue growth hit its highest level since 2022, though it was still below 10% year over year. The growth is coming from its software services division as well as the iPhone, the key drivers for the business over the last decade. iPhone sales showed strong growth but have posted many quarters of stagnation, which should worry investors. This is a mature product that has seen declining unit volumes and upgrade cycles for years. Services revenue keeps growing quickly but is at risk of losing its cash cow Google Search payment if an antitrust lawsuit goes the wrong way. Apple receives an estimated $20 billion a year from Google to make it the default search engine, or about 15% of Apple's overall operating income. This could be wiped out overnight if the lawsuit doesn't work out for them. The big picture with Apple stock In totality, Apple's announced spending plans may seem ambitious but are actually not a huge change from its long-term roadmap. It was already investing in component manufacturing in the United States, and this is just a modest increase in that context. The stock's 12% month-to-date gain may be fleeting as a result. But should investors buy the stock today? Apple is the slowest-growing company among the ""Magnificent Seven"", outside of Tesla, which is grappling with declining sales. The others are putting up solid double-digit revenue growth quarter after quarter. Despite this slow growth, Apple stock trades at a premium to several of its peers on a price-to-earnings basis. Its P/E ratio of 35 is also significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 indexes. This leads me to believe that Apple is overvalued, especially following its recent gains from the $600 billion spending announcement."

That marked a 477% gain from its initial public offering (IPO) price of $29 on Sept. 29, 2019, and would have turned a $1,000 investment into $5,770. At its peak, the exercise bike maker's enterprise value reached $47.2 billion, or 12 times the revenue it would generate in fiscal 2021 (which ended in June 2021). But today, it trades at less than $7 with an enterprise value of $3.1 billion, which is just over one times this year's revenue. Peloton initially attracted a stampede of bulls during the pandemic as gym closures and other lockdown measures drove more people to buy its connected exercise bikes and treadmills, which are tethered to streaming video classes via paid subscriptions. But it couldn't maintain that momentum after the pandemic passed and cheaper competitors entered the market. A brand-tarnishing recall, inflation, and rising interest rates exacerbated that pressure. The company is still struggling to overcome many of those challenges, but I believe its beaten-down stock could potentially deliver a 10-bagger gain (or more) in a few years if it plays its cards right. The bull case vs. the bear case Peloton has been led by three CEOs in less than six years: its co-founder John Foley, who stepped down in 2022; Barry McCarthy, a former Netflix executive who left in 2024; and Peter Stern, a former Apple (AAPL 2.04%) executive. Foley aggressively expanded Peloton with new products and services, but McCarthy and Stern reined in those growth plans, cut costs, and focused on retaining its existing subscriptions. The bulls believe Peloton will stabilize as it expands its stickier subscriptions, and that it's an attractive takeover target for a bigger tech company like Apple. The bears don't think it can expand its subscriptions fast enough to offset the headwinds for its lower-margin hardware business, which sells connected bikes, treadmills, and rowing machines. Under McCarthy, Peloton reduced its equipment prices, rolled out new subscription services, hiked its subscription fees, outsourced its production to a Taiwanese manufacturer, and started selling its products on Amazon and other third-party retailers to expand its presence beyond its first-party website. It also laid off thousands of employees. Is Peloton's turnaround working? In fiscal 2024, Peloton's subscription revenue rose 2% to $1.71 billion, but its sales of connected fitness products fell 12% to $992 million. As a result, its total revenue dropped 4% to $2.7 billion and marked its third consecutive year of declining sales. Its market is also still shrinking as more competitors carve up the field. For the full year, its total number of members dipped 2% to 6.4 million, its number of paid connected fitness subscribers dipped 1% to 2.98 million, and its paid app subscribers fell 26% to 0.62 million. On the bright side, its total gross margin jumped from 33.1% to 44.7% as it reined in its previous hardware discounts and generated more revenue from its higher-margin subscriptions. It also more than halved its net loss from $1.26 billion to $552 million. As a result, its free cash flow (FCF) improved from negative $470 million in fiscal 2023 to negative $86 million in fiscal 2024. For fiscal 2025, Peloton expects its total revenue to decline 9% to around $2.5 billion as its number of paid connected fitness and paid app subscriptions dip 7% and 12%, respectively. Yet it still expects its gross margin to rise to 50% as its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) jumps from $3.5 million to $350 million. Its FCF, which rose to positive $211 million in the first nine months, should also stay positive for the full year. Why Peloton's stock could soar tenfold Peloton faces formidable long-term challenges and hasn't proven its business is sustainable yet. But by expanding its gross margins, narrowing its losses, and strengthening its FCF, it's right-sizing its business and setting up the firm foundations for an eventual recovery. If Peter Stern can successfully preserve Peloton's brand appeal, defend its niche, and finally gain more paid subscribers again, its revenue should rise again. If its top-line growth accelerates again, it could easily command a higher valuation -- and it wouldn't be surprising to see it eventually valued at ten times instead of one times its forward sales. So while I'm not saying Peloton is a guaranteed 10-bagger, I don't think investors should overlook its turnaround potential."

Due to historically lofty stock valuations and extremely concentrated holdings in any market cap-weighted market index, Goldman's team suggested stepping away from the S&P 500 for a while. Instead of -- or in addition to -- standard index trackers such as SPDR S&P 500 Trust (SPY 0.60%) and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO 0.60%), they suggested equal-weighted funds. The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP 0.51%) would be one reasonable example. Let's see how Goldman's bearish forecast has worked out one year later. How the S&P 500 has performed since Goldman Sachs sounded the alarm In the 51 weeks since Goldman's research report, the S&P 500 grew even more lopsided. The index posted a total return of 14.9% between the gloomy market report and October 14, 2025. An equal-weighted S&P 500 tracker gained 4.5% over the same period while the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS 1.04%) enjoyed a 36.6% surge: So the market has not reversed course since October 2024. If anything, the Magnificent 7 giants have soared to new heights as the artificial intelligence (AI) boom continued to drive Wall Street's narrative. AI hardware leader Nvidia (NVDA 0.86%) is the most valuable company on the planet with a $4.37 trillion market cap, far ahead of Apple's (AAPL 2.04%) second-place value of $3.82 trillion. At the same time, the market's nearly 15% return is far ahead of the predicted long-term average of roughly 3%. The Goldman report hasn't been accurate at all so far. Why Goldman Sachs might still have the last laugh (someday) Then again, Goldman's analysts weren't trying to pinpoint market trends for 2025. Their report is an updated long-term view with a 10-year horizon. A downturn, recession, or bear market in the next few years could very well make the report look prophetic after all. It's too early to pass a permanent judgment on it. And on that note, I largely agree with Goldman's assumptions. The stock market is indeed supported by an unprecedented AI boom, where a few companies are gaining market influence over smaller names. This situation could go on for a few more years, but it can't last forever. And what happens if and when the AI-driven hypergrowth fades out? Let's just say that I would rather own equal-weighted funds than cap-weighted ones at that point. How I'm handling the S&P 500 drama in my own portfolio In fact, I like Goldman's thinking so much that I started taking actions in the same vein a month ago. Mind you, I reached similar conclusions without reading the Goldman report. The valuation and concentration issues were simply too obvious to miss. So far, my modest Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight position has performed very similarly to the cap-weighted version. And it's a smaller position, with the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF remaining one of my largest holdings. Still, last Friday provided a dress rehearsal for a full-blown bear market, and the equal-weighted fund posted a slightly smaller dip that day. I'm not talking about game-changing differences here. The Vanguard S&P 500 fund is still one of the best ways to invest in the broader market for the long haul, no matter what shenanigans the economy is up to. And if you own both fund types for a decade or more, the cap-weighted version tends to come out ahead by a small margin. You can't really go wrong with either fund. But if you're putting new money in the market right now, you should at least consider grabbing a few equal-weighted shares. Whether Goldman's dire market predictions turn out to be perfectly accurate or not, I don't mind being prepared for a variety of long-term market trends."

The software maker is hosting a four-day AI World conference starting Monday in Las Vegas, where much of the focus will be on Oracle’s cloud computing business, whose rapid expansion has fueled a 81% run-up in the stock that has made it one of 2025’s best performers in the S&P 500. The event comes just as concerns are building that Oracle is sacrificing profitability for growth from renting computing power to AI companies like OpenAI. Last week, the Information reported Oracle’s cloud margins are lower than many on Wall Street are modeling, sending Oracle shares down as much as 7.1% on Tuesday. Even though the stock quickly recovered the losses, there are lingering questions about the economics of the business, which Oracle has forecast will see revenue jump 700% in the coming three fiscal years. “There are absolutely investors who are concerned about margins, or concerned its targets are very aggressive,” said Mark Martiak, senior partner and financial adviser at Prudential Advisors, whose parent company has about $1.5 trillion in assets under management. “This is an opportunity for Oracle to ease concerns, since a lot of skeptics see the valuation as stretched, especially if a mega-deal like the one it has with OpenAI doesn’t deliver sustained revenue.” Tuesday will feature a keynote address from recently named co-CEO Mike Sicilia, as well as one from founder and chief technology officer Larry Ellison, whose stake in Oracle briefly made him the world’s richest person last month. On Thursday, an investor day is expected to bring updated financial targets. Hopes are high among many on Wall Street. The conference will be “a major catalyst where the company will clarify many of these debates,” Mizuho Securities analyst Siti Panigrahi wrote in a note last week, referring to questions over margins. Bernstein’s Mark Moerdler expects “additional details which should help put some of these issues to bed.” Heavy demand for cloud computing has boosted Oracle’s overall sales, but the big investments required to support it have weighed on profitability. Oracle’s revenue growth is projected to jump to 17% in its current fiscal year, from 8% the year before, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. However, gross margin, which excludes operating expenses, is expected to fall more than 2 percentage points to 68.4%. As recently as fiscal 2021, Oracle’s gross margin was above 80%. Oracle’s rapid growth has firmly established the company as a key AI winner. It inked a cloud-computing deal with OpenAI in September said to be worth $300 billion over five years. A blowout earnings report sent the stock up 36% on Sept. 10. But its soaring stock price has also made it the subject of bubble talk with its valuation recently hitting levels not seen since the dot-com era more than two decades ago. At nearly 42 times profit projected over the coming 12 months, Oracle’s multiple is more than twice its 10-year average and well above that of the Magnificent Seven stocks with the exception of Tesla Inc., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Beyond margins, there are concerns about the spending required to expand Oracle’s cloud computing capacity. The company’s capital expenditures are expected to hit $35.4 billion in fiscal 2026, which ends in May, up 67% from the prior year. As a result, free cash flow is expected to be negative $9.8 billion this year after falling into the red last year for the first time since 1990. Of course, AI bulls have plenty of reasons to be optimistic that the AI narrative will remain intact: Microsoft Corp.’s cloud business is struggling to meet strong demand, Dell Technologies Inc. boosted its revenue and profit growth forecasts for the next four years on AI expectations, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s September sales were robust. Still, the interconnectedness of the major AI players could mean any hint of weakness or excessive sentiment at one could weigh on the broader group, according to Gene Munster, co-founder and managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management. “If one starts to falter, they all will, and the whole trade could break down,” said Munster, who spent more than two decades as an analyst covering companies like Apple Inc. “Oracle has only recently become part of the AI conversation, but until we get to earnings season, this event is what we have to consider whether we’re still at the beginning of the AI trade, or at the beginning of the end.” Top Tech News Wingtech Technology Co. plunged by its daily limit of 10% after the Dutch government moved to exert control over its European unit Nexperia, an unusual move that risks inflaming tensions between China and Europe. Xiaomi Corp. shares fell the most since April after reports that one of its SU7 electric sedan’s doors failed to open after a crash in the southwest Chinese city of Chengdu, trapping at least one person inside. Most major cryptocurrencies rebounded from steep losses suffered over a brutal weekend selloff, as President Donald Trump sought to quell concerns over trade between the US and China.

Shares of the electric vehicle maker, up about 19% this month through Friday's close, are on a roll. Though it's been bumpy, Tesla (TSLA) stock has climbed off year-to-date lows around $222, seen in March, and is approaching break-even. (The stock, which finished last year near $404, ended the week just below $396, down roughly 2% year-to-date.) The recovery is notable for a stock that, as of the end of the first half of the year, was the laggard of the Magnificent 7. It was (and still is) one of only two companies in the big-tech grouping in the red, Apple (AAPL) being the other, tailing all three major U.S. indexes. (The Roundhill ETF that tracks the Magnificent 7 group, known as ""MAGS,"" is up almost 16% this year.) The stock has likely been boosted by factors that have lifted stocks broadly. Investors widely expect the Federal Reserve to cut rates next week, a move generally seen as beneficial to big tech companies. Strong second-quarter earnings growth has offered a measure of optimism to investors attempting to gauge the strength of the economy. (Though there's plenty of concern on that score, too.) But Tesla-specific factors also seem to be lifting the shares. Despite wariness about the health of the company's EV business, some investors appear willing to pay up for the possibility of a big opportunity in robotics, as well as for signs of progress in autonomous driving at both Tesla and more widely. A costly public feud between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump, while not extending valuable EV credits, has apparently cooled. And Tesla's board has offered CEO Elon Musk a pay package that could remove a ""Will he stick around?"" overhang from the company's outlook—albeit at a high price. (Further enthusiasm for the stock may be attributed to what some see as potential for a ""short squeeze"" in which investors who traded against the shares have to buy it as it rises to cover short bets.) Wall Street analysts don't appear ready to climb aboard en masse. Visible Alpha tracks about as many combined bearish and neutral ratings as bull calls, while its mean price target around $327 is substantially below current levels.

In last Friday’s Market on Close segment, John Rowland, CMT, took us through the five-day sector heatmap — and the message was clear: profit-taking is underway in mega-cap tech while money rotates into other areas of the market. Tech Weakness at the Top Despite a rally into the end of the week, technology (XLK) was the worst-performing sector over the last five sessions. Names like NVIDIA (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Broadcom (AVGO), Palantir (PLTR), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) all finished lower — a sign that investors may finally be taking profits after an extended run in high-beta growth leaders. More News from Barchart - Dear Broadcom Stock Fans, Mark Your Calendars for September 4 - CEO Alex Karp Just Sold $60 Million in Palantir Stock. Should You Ditch PLTR Here Too? - Options Traders Are Betting Nvidia Stock Will Move This Much After Earnings This isn’t necessarily bearish for the entire market. Instead, it’s a reminder that concentration risk in tech can unwind quickly, and active traders should look for where capital is moving next. Rotation Into Financials, Industrials, and Energy Financials were among the week’s stronger performers. As John noted, the sector’s breadth stood out: - Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) (BRK.B), long a bellwether for market breadth, posted gains. - Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Bank of America (BAC) also showed strength. - Even asset managers like BlackRock (BLK) contributed to leadership. Industrials and energy also found buyers, suggesting a broadening market that leans on cyclical and value-heavy groups when tech takes a breather. The Telling Signal: Utilities But perhaps the most interesting takeaway came from utilities. Recent high-flyers like Constellation Energy (CEG) and Vistra (VST) — both tied to the data center and AI energy supply narrative — pulled back about 3% on the week. But “old school” utilities like Southern (SO), Duke (DUK), and Dominion (D) finished stronger. Why does this matter? Because Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently hinted at a move toward a lower interest rate environment. Utilities, which are capital-intensive and sensitive to financing costs, tend to benefit disproportionately when borrowing costs decline. That could position them as a quiet outperformer if rates ease."

On Friday, Fed Chair Powell speaks on the economic outlook at the Federal Reserve’s annual symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Regarding tariffs, President Trump widened steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 consumer items that contain the metals, such as motorcycles, auto parts, furniture components, and tableware. The change went into effect on Monday and did not exclude goods already in transit. Last Friday, Mr. Trump said, “I’ll be setting tariffs next week and the week after on steel and on, I would say chips – chips and semiconductors, we’ll be setting sometime next week, week after.” Mr. Trump last week said he planned a 100% tariff on semiconductors but would exempt companies that move chip manufacturing to the US. Mr. Trump also mentioned 200% or 300% tariffs on chips. In other recent tariff news, Mr. Trump last Tuesday extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November. On August 6, Mr. Trump announced that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India’s purchases of Russian oil. On August 5, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced “within the next week or so.” According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced. Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 84% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting, down from 93% last Thursday. The markets are discounting the chances at 55% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29. Earnings reports indicate that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With over 92% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, about 82% of companies exceeded profit estimates. Overseas stock markets today are mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 is down -0.22%. China’s Shanghai Composite climbed to a new 10-year high and closed up +1.04%. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -1.51%. Interest Rates September 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) today are up +6 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield is down -2.5 bp to 4.281%. Sep T-notes are modestly higher today, supported by weakness in equity markets. Also, strength in European government bonds is providing carryover support to T-notes. T-notes remained higher after the Wall Street Journal reported that President Trump is considering firing Fed Governor Lisa Cook over allegations that she committed mortgage fraud. If Cook is fired or resigns, Mr. Trump could appoint another Fed Governor who favors his lower interest rate policies. Supply pressures are limiting gains in T-notes as the Treasury will auction $16 billion of 20-year T-bonds later today. Also, concerns that last week’s bearish US July CPI and PPI reports could keep the Fed from cutting interest rates at next month’s FOMC meeting are weighing on T-notes. European government bond yields today are moving lower. The 10-year German bund yield is down -3.4 bp to 2.716%. The 10-year UK gilt yield is down -6.0 bp to 4.680%. ECB President Lagarde said the Eurozone economy is likely to see slower growth this quarter, with questions over global trade remaining despite recent trade deals with the US reducing uncertainty. UK Jul CPI rose +3.8% y/y, stronger than expectations of +3.7% y/y and the fastest pace of increase in 1.5 years. Jul core CPI also rose +3.8% y/y, stronger than expectations of +3.7% y/y. Swaps are discounting the chances at 7% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.

President Trump is pushing for a summit between Presidents Putin and Zelenskiy soon, and European leaders are discussing a plan to send British and French troops to Ukraine as part of a peace agreement. The outcome of the talks could have macroeconomic implications regarding tariffs and oil prices, and could, of course, have significant consequences for European security. The focus of the markets this week will be on any new tariff news and signs of progress toward a Ukraine peace deal. On Wednesday, the minutes of the July 29-30 FOMC meeting will be released.

On Friday, Fed Chair Powell speaks on the economic outlook at the Federal Reserve’s annual symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Regarding tariffs, President Trump widened steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 consumer items that contain the metals, such as motorcycles, auto parts, furniture components, and tableware. The change went into effect on Monday and did not exclude goods already in transit. Last Friday, Mr. Trump said, “I’ll be setting tariffs next week and the week after on steel and on, I would say chips – chips and semiconductors, we’ll be setting sometime next week, week after.” Mr. Trump last week said he planned a 100% tariff on semiconductors but would exempt companies that move chip manufacturing to the US.

What Does That Mean for TSLA Stock ? ,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-ramping-robotaxi-plans-does-173625003.html,finance.yahoo.com,20250816T001500Z,semi,0.65,"Tesla (TSLA) shares are in focus on Thursday following reports the company is searching for employees for its robotaxi operations in the New York City. The news arrives only days after Elon Musk, the billionaire chief executive of the electric vehicle behemoth, threatened a lawsuit against Apple (AAPL) for antitrust violation. More News from Barchart - Why This Cannabis Penny Stock Could Be Wall Street’s Next Meme Trade Breakout - Peter Thiel-Backed Bullish Is About to IPO. Should You Buy BLSH Stock? Tesla stock has been a tale of two cities this year. For those who invested in it in early 2025, it’s down nearly 20% at the time of writing, but for ones that hopped on in early April, it’s up 50%. Growing Robotaxi Services Could Benefit Tesla Stock TSLA’s push to hire robotaxi operators in NYC indicates forward momentum in its autonomous vehicle strategy, an area investors increasingly view as a high-margin, scalable growth engine. More importantly, plans of expanding into one of the world’s most complex urban environments signals management’s confidence in the company’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology. Note that Tesla does not currently have regulatory authorization for its robotaxi services in NY, but the news still is a positive for TSLA shares. Why? Because it reinforces the company’s commitment to capture future ride-hailing revenue, and its overall stature as a tech innovator, which may boost investor sentiment and speculative value. Guggenheim Warns of a 50% Crash in TSLA Shares CEO Elon Musk has already confirmed Tesla will open its robotaxi services to the public in Austin next month but a senior Guggenheim analyst doubts the company’s ability to effectively execute its robotaxi platform. In a research note on Thursday, Ronald Jewsikow cited TSLA’s lack of transparency around Safety Monitors for his bearish view on the EV stock. Given that human safety drivers are still present in Tesla’s robotaxis, it’s well within reason to assume that full autonomy isn’t ready, despite investor optimism, he told clients. Guggenheim maintains its “Sell” rating on Tesla shares with a $175 price target indicating potential downside of about 50% from current levels. Wall Street Remains Dovish on Tesla While note as bearish as Guggenheim, other Wall Street firms aren’t particularly positive on TSLA stock either. The consensus rating on Tesla stock currently sits at “Hold” only with the mean target of roughly $300 suggesting potential downside of some 10% from here."

Their explosive business success is nobody's secret, so they trade at sky-high valuation ratios. It can make sense to buy into these skyrocketing growth stories, but it's much better to find tomorrow's giants before Wall Street catches on. On that note, I'd like to show you a couple of exciting growth stocks that aren't getting the investor love they deserve. One is a classic, undervalued success story; the other sports a rich valuation but also a lot of short-seller interest. I've had my eye on these stocks for a long time. Here's what you need to know about Dutch Bros (BROS 0.55%) and Roku (ROKU -1.35%). Roku keeps growing, but investors are looking away Media-streaming technology veteran Roku is the overlooked winner here. Roku's sales growth is nearly unstoppable. It did take a break in the inflation crisis of 2022, but it quickly got back on track. Over the last two years, Roku's year-over-year growth has averaged 14.7%. That's faster than Tesla (TSLA 2.58%) at 11.8% and ahead of Apple's (AAPL 2.04%) 6.7%. This little innovator can run with the big dogs. Now, Roku's stock has gained a market-beating 45% over the last year. The chronically undervalued shares are starting to gain some respect at long last. But Roku's stock is trading at just 3.1 times sales, putting it in Wall Street's bargain bin. By contrast, the slower-growing Apple and Tesla stocks are valued at 8.0 and 11.0 times sales, respectively. And the company stands at an important inflection point right now. Roku is exploring international growth more seriously while rolling out better advertising tools and making promising acquisitions in the streaming services market. I can't wait to see Roku regain the stock market's respect as these separate growth catalysts take effect. Roku has been one of my favorite stocks to buy in recent years. It still is, but the buying window may close pretty soon. Dutch Bros brings the buzz -- and short-seller fuzz Drive-thru coffee vendor Dutch Bros is a different story. This stock is getting plenty of investor love, with a price-to-sales ratio just north of 7.1 and a triple-digit price-to-earnings ratio. The stock has gained 52% over the last year, outperforming all the other stocks I've mentioned in this analysis. But the stock also comes with the highest short-selling ratio in this group. With 6.8% of Dutch Bros' shares on loan to bearish investors who expect it to move down, Dutch Bros would be in the top 10% of S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) short ratios if it were a member of that exclusive group. And the stock isn't exactly skyrocketing. Dutch Bros' share price has fallen 32% since February, when a modest list of guidance targets outweighed strong revenue and earnings surprises. Yes, the stock is expensive in many ways. But smart investors can capitalize on Dutch Bros' volatile nature by building a position on price dips -- like the multi-month swoon you see right now. Meanwhile, the company is expanding from its West Coast hub to open locations in every state. For example, they just poured the foundation for a future Dutch Bros next to my kids' high school in the Tampa suburbs. In a few months, I'll get to experience the company's friendly service and exclusive drive-thru focus for myself. And wherever you live, Dutch Bros probably has plans for a store somewhere near your neighborhood, too. With roughly 1,000 locations in operation so far, Dutch Bros is aiming for a cheeky 2,029 store count by the year 2029 and as many as 7,000 in the long run. These are still early days in this company's ambitious expansion project, which is why I don't mind paying a premium for its extreme growth prospects."

This week is packed with massive events that could flip the trend. Here's what traders and investors should watch day-by-day. #1. The Fed is Expected to Hold, But Watch the Language The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is expected to keep rates steady, again, at its July meeting this week. But don’t tune out! Any hints about rate cuts in September could ignite market reactions. Plus, internal dissent is growing at the Fed, with two Trump-appointed governors potentially pushing for cuts. More News from Barchart #2. Inflation’s Moment: The PCE Report The latest PCE data drops Thursday, and it’s best-known as the Fed’s favored inflation measure. If the PCE shows inflation cooling, that’s favorable for a potential September rate cut. But if it heats up again? Expect more volatility. #3. Q2 GDP Recession Watch The first quarter of 2025 showed gross domestic product (GDP) swinging negative. If Q2 goes negative again, that’s a technical recession. While most analysts think it's unlikely, a surprise drop would spook markets hard — especially with the Fed on hold. #4. Tariff Deadline Hits President Trump’s trade deal with the EU is now official, including new 15% tariffs starting Aug. 1. But a deal with Canada is still missing. If no agreement is reached by Thursday, the U.S. could slap on 35% tariffs, throwing trade flows into chaos. #5. All Week: Earnings Bonanza This is the biggest earnings week of the quarter. Massive names like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Exxon (XOM) all report. So far, S&P 500 Index ($SPX) earnings are up 3.2%, beating expectations. But any surprise misses from these giants could rattle sentiment quickly. The Bottom Line Markets are climbing, but there’s no shortage of landmines ahead. This week could mark the top… or fuel the next leg up. Stay alert, watch the data, and hedge your bets while the Cboe Volatility Index ($VIX) is still low.

Kevin Simpson, Capital Wealth Planning founder and CIO, said in a recent program on CNBC that he’s hopeful about Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s shares despite uncertainties around the company’s AI strategy. “I don’t want to pretend to know what they’re going to do when it comes to artificial intelligence or Apple AI, but I do believe that they’re going to do something. I feel like this device (iPhone) will be a great catalyst for us to be able to interface with artificial intelligence. How they decide to do it, I don’t know. But remember, we’re an active portfolio. So I sold out of the position, Frank, just to go back in time back in December. So we liquidated Apple at 247 and a half. At that point, we thought it was a little bit too pricey at 250. At 200, we feel the stock is very attractive and it’s a longer-term investment. We know we’re going to get paid while we wait.” Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is desperately in need of new catalysts. The company’s revenue in China fell 8% in fiscal year 2024, following a 2% decline the previous year. The Chinese market accounts for about 15% of Apple’s total revenue, so this downtrend cannot be ignored. Investors had hopes from the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, but so far, its performance has been weak. Vision Pro faces tough competition from Meta’s $500 Quest and the more affordable Quest 3S, making it hard to justify its $3,500 price tag. The failure of Apple’s HomePod, unable to compete with Amazon’s and Google’s lower-priced offerings, further highlights the challenges in this market. Photo by Alexandr Bormotin on Unsplash Apple’s iPhone 16 has not shown promising growth prospects yet, and investors are still in a wait-and-see mode on the AI platform. Wedgewood Partners stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter: “Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) detracted from performance after investors became impatient with the Company’s AI development efforts – particularly the promises made but promises not kept with Siri integrated with AI. It is much too early to conclude that Apple cannot succeed in developing a compelling AI-assisted offering for its device and software ecosystem. For decades, Apple’s proprietary hardware and software have enabled the Company to consistently provide unmatched user experiences that consumers increasingly rely on a daily basis. Whether Apple – with their unmatched installed base of over a billion user devices – develops its AI with eager partners or over a slightly longer timeframe than what investors hoped for does not change the Company’s core competitive differentiation that comes from years of integrating custom silicon with internal operating system software.”"

Top holdings after the filing: - NASDAQ:AVGO: $15.16 million (6.6% of AUM) - NASDAQ:AAPL: $12.92 million (5.6% of AUM) - NASDAQ:NVDA: $12.85 million (5.6% of AUM) - NASDAQ:GOOGL: $11.44 million (5.0% of AUM) - NASDAQ:MSFT: $11.41 million (5.0% of AUM) As of October 7, 2025, Chipotle shares were priced at $40.93, down 28% over the past year and lagging the S&P 500 by more than 45 percentage points over that same timeframe. Company Overview Company Snapshot Chipotle is a fast casual restaurant chain that operates approximately 3,000 restaurants in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and other European countries. The company targets a broad customer base in the United States and select markets internationally. The company was founded in 1993. Foolish take With Chipotle shares down nearly 30% over the past year, it's not surprising to see institutional investors making a calculated bet on a turnaround for this well-known restaurant brand. In the case of Eastover, this recent purchase represents approximately 1.4% of its AUM so this is hardly a big bet. That said, it does indicate the belief that Chipotle has brighter days ahead. For that brighter future to come to fruition, Chipotle is going to need to reverse its trend of declining same store sales. In the most recent quarter, comparable restaurant sales were down 4% year over year, the second consecutive quarter of negative growth. The same quarter saw revenue slow for the second quarter in a row. It's important to note that these results may have been worse if not for menu price increased of 1.9% in the quarter. Companies that raise prices risk turning off customers. While this pricing increase may have helped soften the blow of this quarters results, there's a chance they've harmed the business in the longer term if customers no longer view the restaurant as a good value proposition. Management attributed these results to the macroeconomic environment, and believes that this trend will reverse. It seems Eastover believes the same thing.

Even with last week's pop, the stock was down about 7% this year as of Aug. 13. Was there anything shared during Tim Cook's White House visit that could help the stock make up lost ground? Here are three takeaways from Apple's big week. 1. Apple takes some tariff risk off the table With its latest pledge of $100 billion, Apple has publicly committed $600 billion to expand its U.S. manufacturing and supply chain footprint. The initiative, which includes its newly announced American Manufacturing Program, is slated to roll out over the next four years. But it looks like it's bearing fruit already. During Cook's Aug. 6 visit to the Oval Office, Trump reiterated his threat to impose tariffs that would double the prices of imported semiconductors and chips, which are the building blocks for smartphones and modern electronics. However, the president said those tariffs wouldn't apply to companies like Apple that have committed to investing in U.S.-based manufacturing. The company got more good news on tariffs that day. Smartphones will continue to be exempt on Indian imports, which the Trump administration is otherwise bumping up to 50% later this month. That's a big win because most iPhones sold in the U.S. are now assembled in India, and the U.S. is the heart of its largest market. With its $600 billion reshoring commitment, the company appears to have bought some tariff relief -- above and beyond the costs it will avoid by increasing its reliance on domestic manufacturing. Tariffs have been weighing on the stock this year, so it's not surprising that the shares rallied on last week's news. 2. For now, iPhones won't be made in America Trump has stated that iPhones sold in America should be manufactured in America. In May, he threatened to slap a 25% tariff on any company that produces U.S.-bound smartphones internationally. But at last week's press event, Cook said iPhones will continue to be manufactured abroad. While the dream of a made-in-America iPhone goes back several administrations, analysts insist it's just not feasible due to the lack of skilled workers and the high costs of labor in the U.S. Instead, Apple is focusing on producing more components for iPhones and other products in the U.S., mainly by expanding its partnerships with suppliers such as Texas Instruments, Applied Materials, GlobalFoundries, and Broadcom. Corning, another established Apple supplier, will dedicate its entire Harrodsburg, Kentucky, factory to making Apple components, thanks to a $2.5 billion investment from Cook's company. The plant will produce all the cover glass for iPhones and Apple Watches -- a first for Apple. The two companies will open a new research and development center at the Kentucky plant as well. At the White House event, Cook declared that his company is creating ""an end-to-end silicon supply chain"" in America, ""from design to equipment to wafer production to fabrication to packaging."" The company estimates that 19 billion American-made chips will be produced for Apple products in 2025. There's a lot to unpack in Apple's U.S. manufacturing plans. But overall, investors should feel confident that the company is in a strong position to manage tariff risk. Its $600 billion reshoring pledge strengthens its domestic supply chain and builds political goodwill, which could be a competitive advantage if the trade war escalates. And the size of the company's investment pledge seems to be enough to appease Trump -- thus keeping an American-made iPhone off the table, at least for now. 3. Apple has the right leader to navigate tariff turmoil Tim Cook's steady leadership was on full display last week, showcasing his supply chain expertise and political savvy. Before being named chief executive officer in 2011, he spent years as the company's operations guru, optimizing a complex global supply chain that now spans more than 50 countries. That experience is paying dividends as Apple navigates escalating tariffs and geopolitical uncertainty. Zooming out from tariff complexities and trade tensions, the company's market capitalization has grown from $350 billion in 2011 to more than $3 trillion today with Cook at the helm. Even with an $800 million tariff hit in Apple's fiscal 2025 third quarter, diluted earnings per share increased 12% compared to the year-ago period. The company also reported record third-quarter revenue. In my opinion, last week's high-profile White House visit was a reminder that Cook has the diplomatic chops to maintain productive relationships with world leaders and the business acumen to keep Apple positioned for growth in a challenging trade environment."

Should You Sell INTC Now or Keep Chasing New Highs ? ,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-america-warns-intel-stock-185455109.html,finance.yahoo.com,20251018T013000Z,semi,0.65,"Bank of America Warns Intel Stock Could Fall from Here. Should You Sell INTC Now or Keep Chasing New Highs? Bank of America just threw cold water on Intel's (INTC) recent rally, downgrading the stock to “Underperform” with a $34 price target. That implies roughly 8% downside from current levels after INTC stock surged nearly 85% in 2025. The analysts believe Intel has climbed too far, too fast. While the company's balance sheet has improved and its foundry business shows external partnership potential, BofA thinks the recent $80 billion jump in market cap more than reflects these positives. More News from Barchart Intel lacks a discernible AI portfolio or strategy at a time when AI is driving the semiconductor industry. Its server CPU business is uncompetitive against rivals like AMD (AMD). Additionally, Intel now has less flexibility to divest its loss-making manufacturing operations than it did before recent government involvement. INTC stock got a boost after the Trump administration took a stake in August and Intel announced a manufacturing partnership with Nvidia (NVDA) last month. Speculation about potential deals with Apple (AAPL) and AMD fueled further gains. But BofA argues these expectations have become detached from reality. Intel dropped over 4% on Tuesday following the downgrade, making it one of the S&P 500's ($SPX) biggest decliners. Most analysts remain neutral on the tech stock, waiting for concrete evidence that Intel's foundry business can attract sustained customer commitments. The average analyst price target sits near BofA's $34 forecast, suggesting limited upside ahead. Is Intel Stock a Good Buy Right Now? Intel closed one of the most dramatic quarters in its history from a capital perspective. It secured $5.7 billion from the U.S. government in exchange for a 10% equity stake, raised $2 billion from SoftBank (SFTBY), sold nearly $1 billion of Mobileye (MBLY) shares, and expects another $3.5 billion from closing the Altera sale. Intel also announced a historic partnership with Nvidia to jointly develop x86 CPUs. The Nvidia collaboration addresses two major market gaps for Intel. First, it brings x86 into Nvidia's NVLink ecosystem for AI supercomputers, creating rack-scale systems previously only available with Nvidia's ARM-based Grace chips. Second, it fuses Intel x86 CPUs with Nvidia GPU chiplets for consumer PCs, targeting 150 million laptops sold annually, where Intel currently has limited presence."

This can be calculated by taking the short strikes and adding or subtracting the premium received. The Barchart Technical Opinion rating is a 64% Buy with a Strengthening short term outlook on maintaining the current direction. Apple is showing an IV Percentile of 80% and an IV Rank of 27.99%. The current level of implied volatility is 29.75% compared to a 52-week high of 65.20% and a low of 15.97%. Apple is due to report Q3 earnings on October 30th, so this trade would have earnings risk if held to expiration. The next Iron Condor we will look at is on the third line using Nvidia (NVDA) for the November 21st expiration. This example involves selling the $130 put and buying the $120 put, then selling the $230 call and buying the $240 call."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the AI Stocks in the Spotlight This Week. On September 24, UBS analyst David Vogt reiterated a Neutral rating and $220.00 price target on the stock. The rating affirmation follows analysis of iPhone 17 availability data across 30 global markets. Based on UBS Evidence Lab data, wait times appears elevated for the base iPhone 17 model but muted for the other three. The firm believes that there is upside risk to iPhone builds driven by the iPhone 17 Base and Air variants. This aligns with recent reports that Apple suppliers are increasing production of the Base model. Meanwhile, wait times for the Pro and Pro Max outside China are consistent with last year, while Air models are flat to down compared to the 16 plus. According to the firm, the transition toward entry-level phone models may limit average selling price upside in the September’25 quarter. Tracking wait times is going to be a key metric, as they flattened or shortened around this time last year. “UBS Evidence Lab data (>Access Dataset) that tracks iPhone availability across 30 geographies suggests elevated YoY wait times for the Base across key end markets, but relatively muted demand for the other three models. We believe that the data is consistent with our view that there is upside risk to iPhone builds, driven by the iPhone 17 Base and Air variants, as well as recent media reports indicating Apple suppliers are increasing iPhone 17 Base production. However, we flag that main adjustments to iPhone builds typically begin in November onwards. Further, we note that ex-China, wait times for the Pro and Pro Max are relatively consistent YoY, and flat to down for the Air vs the 16 Plus. Taking into account the implied price increases for the Air and Pro models, but an implied price decrease for the Base (by raising the starting storage to 256GB), initial demand mixing to the entry-level iPhone may limit ASP upside in the Sept-25 quarter in our view. Wait times will be important to track going forward as we note that they began to flatten or shorten at this time last year depending on the model and geography.” Apple is a technology company known for its consumer electronics, software, and services.

April lows have disappeared into a thriving bull market, and the S&P 500 is up more than 11% year to date. Things could change next week when the Federal Reserve meets and considers an interest rate cut. If it does end up reducing interest rates, which it has indicated that it will, the market is likely to greet the news positively. If for some reason it doesn't, or if it offers any kind of negative assessment of the economy, it could sink the markets again. But that's life in the markets. There are always going to be periods of uncertainty and volatility as well as dips, corrections, and crashes. But the overall arc has always been upward, and investing today is a vote of confidence in the future. If you're looking for excellent stocks that can withstand the oscillations of the market over time, I recommend MercadoLibre (MELI -0.89%), Dutch Bros (BROS 0.55%), and Apple (AAPL 2.04%). 1. MercadoLibre: E-commerce and fintech MercadoLibre is a no-brainer for investors looking for long-term growth. It continues to demonstrate incredible performance, but there's so much further to go. Although its main business is e-commerce, which is still a phenomenal growth driver, it has expanded to become a complete financial app. The dual focus gives it massive long-term opportunities. Despite having been in business almost as long as Amazon, it still reports high growth in e-commerce. Its region is underpenetrated, and it's generating a shift from offline retail to online retail. Total revenue increased 53% year over year (currency neutral) in the second quarter, and gross merchandise volume of goods sold through its e-commerce marketplace increased 37%. New active customers, the foundation of the consumer shift to e-commerce, increased 35% over last year. Management is upgrading the value proposition to make it worthwhile for new shoppers to try MercadoLibre, and the service recently lowered its threshold for free shipping in Brazil from 79 Brazilian reals to 19. It's also incorporating more artificial intelligence, and that's leading to higher engagement, as is infinite scroll, which displays more information on a screen. MercadoLibre's fintech platform has even greater potential in underbanked communities. It offers a large assortment of financial services through its digital wallet, MercadoPago, and growth in monthly active users has been at 30% or higher for the past seven quarters. Another feature I like a lot about this company is its varied markets. It operates in 18 Latin American markets, and they're not all the same. Last year, it was experiencing pressure in Argentina, historically its largest market, but that was offset by success in Brazil and Mexico, its other two largest markets. That kind of hedge gives MercadoLibre stability even as some of its markets look risky. 2. Dutch Bros: Growing its brand in coffee Dutch Bros is almost as old as Starbucks, but it's been a small chain concentrated in Oregon. Although it's been expanding slowly for years, it made a clever move when the pandemic shifted coffee shop consumption behaviors to ride the tide and take its drive-thru coffee concept national. The original pilot, bringing the chain south through California, was extremely successful. The company took it up a notch with some very smart decisions to bring in new management and try new store formats as it keeps moving east, and it's been a roaring success. When you hear coffee, you might be envisioning steaming hot cups. But Dutch Bros' core beverages are cold drinks and energy drinks. It offers customized beverages featuring all kinds of flavors and shots, and it has carved out a significant and growing niche in this space. Customers love it, and the future looks wide open. The results speak for themselves. Revenue increased 28% year over year in the second quarter, driven by a 6.1% increase in same-store sales. Contribution margin, which measures store profitability, improved from 30.8% to 31.1%, and adjusted net income rose from $31.2 million to $45.5 million. The investing thesis is made even more compelling by the expansion opportunities. Management recently raised its long-term goal from 4,000 stores to 7,000, a sevenfold increase from today's store count. 3. Apple: Don't give up on it Finally, Apple might seem like a contrarian call today, but its recently stagnating price means that there's time to buy before it starts to soar again. The naysayers might point to slowing growth and too much dependence on the iPhone. But Apple doesn't need a lot of products to generate engagement and high sales. It has developed an incomparable ecosystem of products that work together, plus loyal fans who love its quality and stay in that ecosystem, buying new upgrades and complementary products. One recent concern has been that it's not staying competitive in artificial intelligence (AI). It has released a slew of Apple Intelligence services, but it doesn't seem to have found a breakout AI model like many of its most direct competitors. But I think it's highly likely that it will come through. Apple strives to be different, and better, and its AI will reflect that. One recent development just launched for its AirPods Pro earbuds is the ability to translate conversations on the spot. This is the kind of innovation that will make Apple Intelligence stand out. Apple stock is down 6% this year, trailing the market, and now is a great time for the forward-thinking investor to take a position."

Is It Time to Buy ? ,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/07/apple-stock-investors-got-great-news-time-to-buy/?source=iedfolrf0000001,www.fool.com,20250907T091500Z,semi,0.65,"Shares of Apple (AAPL 2.04%) have declined 4% this year, making it the second-worst performing member of the ""Magnificent Seven."" Only Tesla has declined more sharply. But Apple recently caught a big break when a federal judge ruled on remedies in an antitrust lawsuit involving Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL 0.82%) (GOOG 0.86%). Here's what investors should know. A federal judge rejected the most severe remedies proposed by the Justice Department In recent years, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has filed and won two antitrust suits against Alphabet. The first dealt with its monopoly in internet search, and the second dealt with its monopoly in adtech software. The key events in the first lawsuit are listed below: - October 2020: The DOJ filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google-parent Alphabet, accusing the company of monopolizing the search advertising market. - August 2024: Federal Judge Amit Mehta ruled against Alphabet, determining the company had engaged in illegal practices to maintain its monopoly in search advertising. - November 2024: The Department of Justice proposed that Alphabet be forced to sell its Chrome browser and be prevented from paying Apple for default search placement on iOS devices. - September 2025: Federal Judge Mehta rejected the most severe remedies proposed by the DOJ. He said Alphabet can no longer negotiate exclusive search deals, but the company can continue paying Apple to distribute its search engine. The ruling is undoubtedly good news for Alphabet and its shareholders, especially the part about maintaining control over Chrome. As the most popular web browser, Chrome not only affords Alphabet insight into consumer behavior, which enables targeted advertising, but also funnels users to Google Search, which generates advertising revenue. However, Apple was also a beneficiary of the remedies imposed by the judge. Alphabet pays Apple more than $20 billion annually as part of an exclusive arrangement that made Google the default search engine on iOS devices. That's why your iPhone automatically selects Google when you enter search text into the Safari browser bar. Mehta prohibited exclusive agreements in the future, meaning Apple can feature alternative search engines alongside Google. But he allowed Alphabet to pay partners to distribute its search engine. That means the ruling preserves a substantial revenue stream for Apple's services business while simultaneously freeing the company to explore other options, such as the artificial intelligence (AI) web search tool the company is reportedly developing. The consensus target price increased modestly, but Apple stock still looks expensive Following the antitrust ruling, Craig Moffett at Moffett Nathanson upgraded his rating on Apple from sell to neutral. Wamsi Mohan at Bank of America raised his target price to $260 per share from $250 per share. Other analysts also tweaked their forecasts, resulting in the average target price increasing to $237 per share, up from $231 per share. However, the new consensus still implies about 4% downside from the current share price of $240. And Apple still has an expensive valuation compared to other big technology companies. The stock trades at 36 times earnings, which looks particularly rich when analysts estimate earnings will increase by just 10% annually over the next three years. Those figures give Apple a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 3.6. Comparatively, Alphabet has a PEG ratio of 1.7, Amazon's is 1.9, Meta Platforms' is 1.5, Microsoft's is 3, and Nvidia's PEG ratio is 1.2. Tesla is the only member of the ""Magnificent Seven"" with a higher PEG ratio than Apple. I have frequently argued Apple stock is overvalued, and my opinion has not changed. The company dodged a bullet with the recent antitrust ruling, but it still faces other hardships. Most notably, its innovation engine has stalled. After launching the iPhone in 2007, the iPad in 2010, the Apple Watch in 2015, and AirPods in 2017, the company has gone eight years without a groundbreaking new product."

This is how Nvidia captured a significant portion of the AI computing market, delivering substantial gains to its shareholders. So, when Jensen Huang calls a company's stock a ""very smart buy,"" investors should listen up. What company was Huang talking about when he mentioned this? It's none other than a key Nvidia supplier, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM). Taiwan Semiconductor is a key Nvidia supplier During a visit to TSMC, Jensen Huang stated: Well, first of all, I think TSMC is one of the greatest companies in the history of humanity, and anybody who wants to buy TSMC stock is a very smart person. That's huge praise from the man who leads and founded the world's largest company. But is he right? Taiwan Semiconductor, widely known as TSMC, is in a strong and unique position in the chip world. It's a semiconductor foundry that produces chips for companies like Nvidia that lack the in-house capabilities to do it themselves. This fosters a strong working relationship, as they each depend on one another. Nvidia isn't the only company that uses TSMC; others, such as AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), do also. This raises a key point about TSMC: It often produces chips for companies that are competing against each other. AMD and Nvidia are vying for supremacy in AI computing power, and Apple's iPhones are competing against Google's Pixel phones, which have just started using TSMC-made chips. With TSMC remaining neutral and acting only as a supplier to companies battling it out, it's in a position to capitalize on several key trends without needing to develop the winning product. As long as TSMC can stay on top with the technology it offers, it will maintain its market leadership position. By the end of the year, TSMC's next chip node, the 2nm (nanometer) chip, will be in production. This chip offers substantially better power consumption (25% to 30% improvement) compared to the 3nm variety when configured at the same speed. While concern grows about the power consumption of AI data centers, this innovation is expected to be a massive hit among tech companies. Additionally, TSMC has 1.6nm and 1.4nm designs in the pipeline, which are expected to offer similar power consumption improvements."

",https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/05/down-19-this-year-has-apple-stock-become-a-bargain/?source=iedfolrf0000001,www.fool.com,20250806T013000Z,semi,0.65,"Apple (AAPL 2.04%) is one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a market cap of $3 trillion. With around 1.5 billion active iPhone users worldwide, it has a massive userbase, which is connected to its vast and growing ecosystem. Warren Buffett once referred to Apple as one of the best businesses he's ever known. Yet, despite all its success, accolades, and seemingly terrific growth prospects, the stock has been struggling this year, down by 19% as of the end of last week. While the company has been falling behind in the race to develop artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, is that enough of a reason to justify such an underwhelming performance? Or could Apple be one of the best tech stocks to buy right now, given its reduced valuation? Is Apple's business heading in the right direction? A challenge for Apple in recent years has been its diminishing growth rate. With a troubling AI rollout that has resulted in the company delaying features, there hasn't been a strong upgrade cycle with users buying new iPhones. There hasn't been an overwhelming reason to do so, especially if people are anticipating new AI features on the horizon; there's been arguably more of a reason to wait. The company recently reported earnings, and it did experience an unusual uptick in sales, with its top line rising by close to 10%. For the period ending June 28, iPhone sales rose by 13%. But a big reason for that is likely to do with tariffs. The fear of rising prices in the future may have resulted in many people deciding to upgrade their devices sooner rather than later. Thus, it wasn't necessarily innovative new products that pushed demand up, but rather, a fear of challenging macroeconomic conditions ahead. As a result, investors haven't been buying up Apple's stock despite the seemingly strong growth -- the best the company has achieved in multiple years. The good news is that the company's revenue may be stronger next year. Apple is launching a new foldable phone (without creases), which may give customers an exciting new product to buy. Just how cheap is Apple stock today? There's little doubt about how strong Apple's business is. This is still a company that generates more than $400 billion in annual revenue, with excellent profit margins of around 24%. The big question, however, is whether the stock is too expensive, especially if its growth rate may not be all that high going forward. Shares of Apple are down big this year, and that has pushed the stock's price-to-earnings multiple down to around its five-year average. Apple is still nowhere near its 52-week low of $169.21, which it reached in April when U.S. President Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs. But the consensus analyst price target for the stock is set to around $237, indicating that analysts do see Apple rising by around 17% in value from where it is right now. Should you buy Apple stock today? Apple's stock has been having a challenging year in 2025. With a vast user base and the business expanding its array of services over the years, there's still room for the company to become much larger in the future. But at 30 times its earnings, I can understand the apprehension from investors in buying the stock, as that's a steep multiple for a company where double-digit sales growth may simply not be the norm. While it's still a good business to invest in for the long term, I don't think Apple's valuation is cheap enough where there's enough margin of safety to make it worth buying, given the uncertainty around tariffs and the economy. Although it's down this year, the stock is by no means a bargain."

The analyst from UBS, David Vogt, noted that there was a significant drop in iPhone demand in June after two strong months of sales. In June, iPhone sales dropped 18% compared to the same period last year. A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. The analyst believes that the earlier strong performance was because consumers were concerned about potential iPhone price increases due to tariffs. Even with the slowdown in June, UBS estimates that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) sold about 45 million iPhone units in the June quarter, which represents an increase of 3.4% year-over-year. This figure is about 1.5 million units higher than the previous estimate by UBS. The research firm pointed out that the weaker US dollar during the quarter should help provide a slight tailwind to Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) revenue. UBS slightly increased its estimates for Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) June quarter but lowered its forecast for the September quarter because of “likely iPhone softness” that is anticipated to be “below seasonal” after the earlier demand pull-forward.

S . and EU Reach Trade Deal , Big Tech Earnings and Fed Meeting in Focus",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stocks-set-extend-record-rally-100243652.html,finance.yahoo.com,20250728T114500Z,semi,0.65,"September S&P 500 E-Mini futures (ESU25) are up +0.28%, and September Nasdaq 100 E-Mini futures (NQU25) are up +0.46% this morning, pointing to a higher open on Wall Street after U.S. President Donald Trump reached a trade deal with the European Union. President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the EU agreement on Sunday at his golf club in Turnberry, Scotland. The U.S. would impose a baseline tariff of 15% on European goods, including automobiles. The new tariff rate will take effect on August 1st, according to a U.S. official. Mr. Trump said tariffs on steel and aluminum, which are currently at 50%, would remain unchanged. He also said the EU had agreed as part of the deal to purchase $750 billion worth of American energy products, invest an additional $600 billion in the U.S., and buy “vast amounts” of military equipment. In addition, U.S. goods shipped to Europe won’t be charged tariffs. This week, market participants look ahead to earnings reports from major tech names, the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision, as well as key economic data, including the jobs report, the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge, and the first estimate of second-quarter GDP. In Friday’s trading session, Wall Street’s major equity averages ended higher, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 notching new all-time highs. Deckers Outdoor (DECK) surged over +11% and was the top percentage gainer on the S&P 500 after the company posted upbeat FQ1 results and provided solid FQ2 EPS guidance. Also, Newmont (NEM) climbed more than +6% after the gold miner reported stronger-than-expected Q2 results. In addition, Centene (CNC) rose over +6% after the health insurer unveiled a plan to address issues in its Affordable Care Act business to ensure profitability in 2026. On the bearish side, Charter Communications (CHTR) tumbled more than -18% and was the top percentage loser on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 after the company posted weaker-than-expected Q2 EPS. Economic data released on Friday showed that U.S. durable goods orders slumped -9.3% m/m in June, better than expectations of -10.4% m/m, while core durable goods orders, which exclude transportation, rose +0.2% m/m, stronger than expectations of +0.1% m/m. “The pace of earnings so far this month has been positive, economic data has been hanging in there, and we’re even starting to get some sense of clarity on tariffs. You can’t fault investors for being optimistic,” said Bespoke Investment Group. Second-quarter corporate earnings season continues in full force, and investors await fresh reports from high-profile companies this week, including Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Mastercard (MA), Visa (V), Arm (ARM), Qualcomm (QCOM), KLA Corp. (KLAC), Procter & Gamble (PG), United Parcel Service (UPS), Exxon Mobil (XOM), and Chevron (CVX). According to Bloomberg Intelligence, companies in the S&P 500 are expected to post an average +3.2% increase in quarterly earnings for Q2 compared to the previous year, slightly above the pre-season forecast of +2.8%. Market watchers will also focus on the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision and Chair Jerome Powell’s post-policy meeting press conference. The central bank is widely expected to leave the Fed funds rate unchanged in a range of 4.25% to 4.50%. The decision comes amid criticism of Mr. Powell by President Trump and repeated calls for the central bank to lower interest rates. Powell and other Fed officials have emphasized the importance of patience as the Trump administration’s tariffs pose a risk of reigniting inflation. “We believe this [Fed] meeting will be a non-event with rates left on hold and quantitative tightening likely left unchanged,” ING analysts said in a note. This week’s top-tier U.S. economic data will offer insight into whether the Fed may be justified in lowering interest rates in the coming months. The advance estimate of second-quarter U.S. gross domestic product, the July Nonfarm Payrolls report, and the latest reading of the core personal consumption expenditures price index will be the main highlights. Any indications of a cooling labor market or slowing economy could boost the likelihood of rate cuts resuming in September or October. Other noteworthy data releases include the U.S. JOLTs Job Openings, the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index, the S&P/CS HPI Composite - 20 n.s.a., ADP Nonfarm Employment Change, Pending Home Sales, the Employment Cost Index, Initial Jobless Claims, Personal Income, Personal Spending, the Chicago PMI, Average Hourly Earnings, the Unemployment Rate, the S&P Global Manufacturing PMI, Construction Spending, the ISM Manufacturing PMI, and the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Index. Meanwhile, the August 1st deadline for the U.S. to impose reciprocal tariffs also takes center stage. Optimism has been building that the U.S. will reach trade agreements with multiple countries before the deadline. The U.S. economic data slate is largely empty on Monday. In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note is at 4.373%, down -0.30%. The Euro Stoxx 50 Index is up +0.82% this morning after the European Union and the U.S. reached a trade deal over the weekend. Semiconductor, automobile, and pharmaceutical stocks led the gains on Monday. The deal will see the U.S. place a 15% tariff on most EU goods, which is half the rate threatened by U.S. President Trump earlier this month. At the same time, tariff rates on spirits remain under negotiation. While the trade deal averted a further escalation, some analysts and industry experts were disappointed. For example, the president of Germany’s Ifo Institute for Economic Research described the agreement as a “humiliation for the EU,” highlighting the power imbalance between the two sides. Also, Commerzbank analysts said in a note that European firms will continue to find it “significantly more difficult to export to their most important foreign market,” which will weigh on Europe’s economy. Investor focus now shifts to the first estimate of second-quarter Eurozone gross domestic product on Wednesday and preliminary inflation data for July on Friday. In corporate news, Heineken (HEIA.NA) dropped more than -5% after the Dutch brewer said it was considering all options to address long-term tariff challenges, including relocating production. The European economic data slate is mainly empty on Monday. Asian stock markets today settled mixed. China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed up +0.12%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed down -1.10%. China’s Shanghai Composite Index closed slightly higher today as investors awaited details from U.S.-China trade talks and the upcoming Politburo meeting. Insurance stocks led the gains on Monday after the industry body lowered the reference rate for life insurance products. Rare earth stocks also gained ground. Sentiment was buoyed after the South China Morning Post reported that the U.S. and China are expected to extend their tariff truce by another three months. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng are set to meet in Stockholm later today. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that his administration was nearing a trade agreement with China, though he did not provide further details. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs raised its 12-month target for the MSCI China index to 90 from 85, citing higher valuations, a more optimistic outlook for a trade agreement with the U.S., and a stronger yuan. On the economic front, data released over the weekend showed that China’s industrial profits continued to fall in June, with authorities poised to ramp up efforts to curb excessive competition that’s pressuring prices and deepening the impact of U.S. tariffs. Industrial profits fell 4.3% in June from the same period last year, following a 9.1% decline in May, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Investors await a high-level meeting that is anticipated to occur sometime in the final days of July. The Politburo, China’s top decision-making body, will likely focus on curbing excessive competition and addressing overcapacity, while many analysts view major stimulus as unlikely. In corporate news, AIA Group rose about +5% in Hong Kong after Morgan Stanley boosted its price target on the stock to HK$96. Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index closed lower today as investors continued to take profits following a recent rally triggered by the country’s trade agreement with the U.S. Bank and technology stocks led the declines on Monday. Investors are also concerned that Japan’s weakened government could give in to opposition demands for tax cuts, straining the country’s already stretched fiscal position. Meanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba signaled he intended to remain in office despite mounting pressure from within the ruling party for his resignation. “Consensus in the market is for Ishiba to remain in office,” and if he were to announce his resignation, it would be a positive surprise for stock prices, as a change in government would boost the economy, according to Shoji Hirakawa, chief global strategist at Tokai Tokyo Intelligence Lab. Investor focus this week is on the Bank of Japan’s monetary policy decision, where the central bank is expected to keep its benchmark rate unchanged at 0.5%. Governor Kazuo Ueda’s reaction to the U.S. trade deal will be in focus after his deputy stated that the agreement increased the chances of economic projections being met, a key condition for an additional rate hike. Investors will also be focused on corporate earnings, with Fujitsu, Tokyo Electron, and Nissan Motor Co. among the companies scheduled to release their results. In corporate news, Advantest slumped over -8% after UBS downgraded the stock to Sell. Also, Screen Holdings plunged more than -9% after the chip-making equipment maker posted a 12.2% drop in Q1 operating profit. The Nikkei Volatility Index, which takes into account the implied volatility of Nikkei 225 options, closed up +3.07% to 22.85. Pre-Market U.S. Stock Movers Tesla (TSLA) rose over +1% in pre-market trading after President Trump announced a trade agreement with the EU, where the automaker operates a factory that manufactures hundreds of thousands of Model Y vehicles and millions of battery cells. Also, CEO Elon Musk said that the company entered into a $16.5 billion agreement with Samsung to manufacture next-generation chips. Lockheed Martin (LMT) and RTX Corp.

That, however, doesn't detract from the massive wealth he has built over his 60-year tenure at Berkshire Hathaway. Between 1964 and 2024, Berkshire Hathaway generated a staggering 5,502,284% return compared to the S&P 500's total returns (including reinvested dividends) of 39,054%. Buffett has also built a massive portfolio of over 40 stocks through Berkshire Hathaway over the years, and his investing acumen and proven track record attract a large following, especially among long-term investors. Buffett buys quality companies for the long term, many of which are dominant players in their respective industries, with strong management teams. Right now, the 10 Buffett stocks listed below are no-brainer buys (in no particular order). 1. Amazon Buffett didn't own Amazon (AMZN -0.61%) shares until 2019 when one of his investment managers bought them. In an interview with CNBC, Buffett even called himself an ""idiot"" for not buying the stock sooner. Amazon has remained a steady part of Buffett's portfolio since then, and the company has grown by leaps and bounds in the meantime. Today, Amazon is not only the world's largest e-commerce player but also the world's largest cloud computing platform, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) dominating 29% market share in the first quarter of 2025. Since AWS is also Amazon's largest profit and cash driver, buying this Buffett stock today is largely a bet on artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing, two trillion-dollar markets in the making. 2. BYD When Charlie Munger, the late vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, prodded Warren Buffett to buy BYD (BYDD.F -0.58%) (BYDDY -1.09%) stock in 2008, not many had even heard of the company. Today, China-based BYD sells more electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles combined than Tesla (TSLA 2.58%) and is one of the largest electric vehicle (EV) battery makers in the world. In 2024, BYD sold 4.7 million vehicles compared to Tesla's sales of 1.8 million. BYD's recently launched Super-e platform outperforms Tesla's superchargers. BYD's global sales jumped 39% year over year during the first five months of 2025, and sales outside China hit record highs. Its big investment plans in advanced EV technologies and key regions, such as Europe, make it a solid stock to buy. 3. Visa As the largest payments processing company in the world, Visa (V 1.94%) enjoys massive advantages of scale and network effects. In the 12 months ending March 31, 2025, Visa processed global transactions worth a staggering $16 trillion. Since Visa doesn't lend money or issue credit cards but simply earns fees on every transaction, it generates operating margins of over 60%. Visa stock has been an immensely powerful wealth compounder over the years and should continue to generate big returns in the coming years, driven by its innovation in AI, value-added services such as fraud management and data analytics, and the global growth in digital payments. 4. Mastercard Mastercard (MA 2.08%) and Visa hold a near-duopoly in the global payments processing market, and Buffett owns both stocks. Mastercard enjoys similar strengths to Visa and generated a 55% operating margin in 2024. But it has a much larger global presence than Visa. In 2024, Mastercard generated 56% of its revenue from the Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, and Africa regions. That gives the company massive exposure to markets that are increasingly moving toward a cashless system. Also, almost 40% of its revenue comes from value-added services, which are now becoming a growth engine for the company. These two factors in particular make this multibagger Buffett stock a no-brainer buy today. 5. Chevron Chevron (CVX 0.94%) is among the five largest holdings in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. The oil and gas major just acquired Hess in a $53 billion deal and now owns a 30% stake in the prized Guyana Stabroek Block, in addition to oil assets in the Bakken and Gulf of America (formerly Gulf of Mexico) and natural gas assets in Southeast Asia. Chevron expects the Hess acquisition to drive ""significant"" production and free-cash-flow growth into the 2030s, which should also mean bigger returns for shareholders. Buffett loves dividends, and Chevron is one of the best oil dividend stocks, with a 38-year streak of annual dividend increases and a dividend yield of 4.5%. 6. Occidental Petroleum Buffett has been buying shares in Occidental Petroleum (OXY -0.30%) hand over fist and now owns over a 28% stake in the oil and gas giant. High debt, especially after the $12 billion CrownRock acquisition last year, has been the biggest deterrent for investors in this stock. Occidental, however, is steadily repaying debt, and management has set a goal to not only maximize free cash flow in 2025 but also sustain ""strong cash flow generation potential over the next several years."" While CrownRock will boost its oil and gas production, Occidental expects its Oxychem chemical business to become a bigger growth driver in the future. That makes it a compelling stock to buy now. 7. Bank of America Bank of America (BAC 1.67%) is the second-largest bank in the U.S. with the highest retail deposit market share. The bank has clocked 26 consecutive quarters of growth in net new checking accounts, with deposits crossing $2 trillion in the most recent quarter. Other businesses, such as investment banking and asset management, have also posted strong growth in recent quarters. Buffett has made an absolute killing in Bank of America stock since he first bought it in 2011. It is currently Berkshire Hathaway's third-largest holding. With the bank recently announcing a fresh buyback program worth a staggering $40 billion and increasing its dividend by 8%, it's a solid stock to buy. 8. Kroger Berkshire Hathaway owned a 7% stake in Kroger as of April 28, 2025. Kroger is the largest supermarket chain in the U.S., with over 2,700 stores. It also owns more than 2,200 pharmacies and 1,700 fuel centers. It's a recession-proof business that generates steady cash flows, a good chunk of which goes to shareholders. Kroger recently increased its dividend for the 19th straight year and has grown its dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 13% since 2006. Although Kroger's planned merger with Albertsons fell through, its private-label brands, e-commerce, and loyalty programs continue to gain traction. As a defensive, dividend-paying consumer stock, Kroger is a no-brainer Buffett stock to buy. 9. Coca-Cola Buffett first bought shares in Coca-Cola (KO 1.27%) in 1988 and is a big fan of its namesake soft drink. Coca-Cola is the largest beverage company in the world, selling 200 brands in 200 countries and territories. Of those, 30 are billion-dollar brands. Coca-Cola makes beverage concentrates and syrups and uses its extensive bottling partner and vendor network to manufacture, package, and sell products globally. Coca-Cola has generated a net income margin of over 20% for six consecutive years and is targeting 4% to 6% growth in organic revenue and 7% to 9% growth in currency-neutral earnings per share in the long term. Coca-Cola is also a Dividend King, having increased its dividend for 63 consecutive years. The earnings and dividend growth potential make it a compelling stock to buy. 10. Apple Apple (AAPL 2.04%) is the crown jewel of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. At over 20% of the portfolio, Apple is Buffett's largest holding. Apple's unparalleled brand power, an ecosystem that locks in consumers to its products and services, and strong balance sheet are the biggest reasons why Buffett loves the stock. In 2024, Apple generated 57% of its sales outside the Americas. Overall, while iPhones were its highest-selling product, with a 51% share of total net sales, 25% of sales came from services, including the App Store, cloud services, and advertising. This is a rapidly growing, high-margin business. Apple is also expanding its product line and financial services while aggressively integrating AI into its value chain. These growth catalysts make Apple a solid Buffett stock to buy now and hold."

Mixed opinions surround the data: some traders see the weak numbers and revisions as evidence of a cooling economy, potentially signaling a sideways to downward correction in stock indexes, especially after the S&P 500’s recent highs. At the same time, some feel the negative revisions were politically motivated. This could lead to the numbers being revised higher in the coming months. Others argue the unemployment rate’s modest rise to 4.2% and steady wage growth suggest no immediate recession, limiting downside risk. In addition, the tariff uncertainties and the lack of an FOMC meeting until September 17 could catalyze increased volatility or a correction if market sentiment sours further. August poses challenges for stock index traders due to reduced liquidity from summer vacations, with daily trading volume historically dropping compared to busier months like October. This thinner market can lead to overreactions when reports or events like the August 13 CPI release hit the tape or a new tariff is imposed, as fewer participants absorb order flow, amplifying price swings. While the Nasdaq has a 15-year seasonal buy pattern in August, this upward bias is unlikely to be a straight line. Traders should expect choppy price action with an upward tilt, requiring disciplined risk management to navigate exaggerated volatility. Technical Outlook Source: Barchart The Nadaq QQQ exchange-traded fund (ETF) has rallied approximately 174 points, 44% of the April 2025 lows. Like other stock indexes, the rally has had shallow corrections, not offering some traders or investors any bargains to enter the market. The rally pushed prices to all-time highs. Technically, this has the 50 SMA uptrending under current prices, which is bullish. If August turns into a correction, a logical first support area will be the old all-time highs near the 50 SMA. Corrections are healthy for markets. Don’t be too quick to join the top and bottom pickers saying this is the end of the bull market. Assets to Trade the Nasdaq Market Standard Size Futures: Nasdaq-100 futures (NQ), traded on CME, contract size $20 x Nasdaq-100 Index. Micro Size Futures: Micro E-mini Nasdaq-100 futures (NM), traded on CME, contract size $2 x Nasdaq-100 Index. ETFs: Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index; leveraged ETFs like ProShares UltraPro QQQ (TQQQ) or inverse ETFs like ProShares Short QQQ (PSQ). Options: Options on Nasdaq-100 futures (NQ), Micro E-mini Nasdaq-100 futures (NM), or ETFs like QQQ. Individual Stocks (Closely Correlated): Stocks like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Nvidia (NVDA), and Meta (META), which are heavily weighted in the Nasdaq-100 (combined weight approximately~40%) The major stock indexes—Nasdaq-100, S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Russell 2000—exhibit high correlation, with historical daily correlations between Nasdaq-100 and S&P 500 averaging 0.90-0.95 over the past decade. This tight relationship means the Nasdaq’s upcoming seasonal upward bias in August will likely influence these other indexes with varying magnitudes due to sector differences. Traders should expect coordinated moves across these markets, with potential choppiness from low August liquidity amplifying reactions to economic reports or events. Other Stock Indexes: S&P 500 futures: ES or ET Dow Jones Industrial Average futures: YM or YR Russell 2000 futures: QR or RX Seasonal Pattern Seasonal pattern research gives traders an edge by identifying historical price tendencies that often repeat due to recurring economic, behavioral, or market structure factors. For example, the Nasdaq’s 15-year average of a 130-point gain during the seasonal window in August reflects consistent historical seasonal buying. By studying these patterns, traders can anticipate potential moves, align strategies with historical probabilities, and manage risk around expected volatility or consolidation periods. This data-driven approach provides a statistical foundation to complement other analyses, helping traders make informed entry, exit, and position sizing decisions. Source: Moore Research Center, Inc. (MRCI) Source: MRCI Did the recent drop in the stock indexes cause you to panic? What if you had seen this chart before the sell-off? While there are no guarantees in trading, MRCI research shows the Nasdaq market has experienced some weakness near the end of July into August before it finally found a bottom and began a rally into mid-September during the past 15 years (blue line). To refine this pattern, MRCI research (yellow box) has found that the Nasdaq market has closed higher on approximately September 15 than on August 11 for 13 of the past 15 years (87% occurrence). As a crucial reminder, while seasonal patterns can provide valuable insights, they should not be the basis for trading decisions. Traders must consider various technical and fundamental indicators, risk management strategies, and market conditions to make informed and balanced trading decisions. In Closing… August’s trading landscape, shaped by the employment report’s miss and prior-month revisions, has sparked debate about a potential market correction, amplified by tariff uncertainties and no FOMC meeting until September 17. Low liquidity from summer vacations can exaggerate price swings during events like the August 13 CPI release or new tariffs, making navigation tricky. Yet, the Nasdaq’s historical seasonal pattern shows a consistent August rally, often dipping early before climbing into mid-September. Will you leverage this seasonal edge to trade smarter with Nasdaq futures, QQQ ETFs, or stocks like Apple, or let volatility catch you unprepared? Pair this insight with technicals like QQQ’s 50 SMA support and disciplined risk management to avoid the panicked crowd.

For example, he disagrees with those who predict that AI will take over many jobs done by humans anytime soon. Griffin also recently stated that generative AI isn't helping hedge funds beat the market. However, Griffin's own hedge fund, Citadel Advisors, is heavily invested in AI. And Griffin just increased his position in one AI stock by over 1,600%. Griffin's aggressive AI buy Citadel significantly added to its stake in Nvidia in the second quarter of 2025, but by roughly 414%, rather than by over 1,600%. It also bought another 3.27 million shares of Amazon in Q2, an increase of around 158%, compared to the previous quarter. However, neither Nvidia nor Amazon ranks as Griffin's most aggressive AI buy among Citadel's top 10 holdings. That honor goes to Microsoft (MSFT 0.50%). Citadel added 1.87 million shares of the tech giant, enough to boost its position by a whopping 1,636%. At the end of Q2, the hedge fund's stake in Microsoft was worth around $985 million. Microsoft has been a familiar name in Citadel's portfolio for years. Griffin first initiated a position in the stock in 2013 and has actively bought and sold shares of the big software company along the way. Citadel often hedges its positions in stocks using options and has taken this approach with Microsoft. At the end of Q2, Citadel owned call options for roughly 107.8 million of the tech giant's shares and put options for nearly 7 million shares. Lots of Microsoft fans Griffin isn't the only billionaire who has been scooping up shares of Microsoft. Israel ""Izzy"" Englander added more shares for his Millennium Management hedge fund in Q2. So did Chase Coleman for Tiger Global Management's portfolio. Wall Street absolutely loves Microsoft, too. Of the 58 analysts surveyed by S&P Global in October who cover the stock, 57 rated it as a buy or strong buy. The sole outlier recommended holding Microsoft. Analysts think Microsoft has more room to run after its gain of over 20% this year. The average 12-month price target reflects an upside potential of roughly 21%. Why is Microsoft so popular these days? The company is benefiting tremendously from a massive AI tailwind. It has integrated OpenAI's GPT-5 throughout its product lineup. Microsoft Azure trails only Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the cloud market, which is booming, thanks largely to organizations scrambling to build and deploy generative AI applications. Is Microsoft stock a buy? At first glance, the enthusiasm for Microsoft might seem overdone. After all, we're talking about a stock that trades at more than 33 times forward earnings. That's a steep valuation. However, I think Microsoft deserves to be priced at a premium. The company continues to make money hand over fist. Microsoft reported revenue of $281.7 billion in its latest fiscal year, which ended June 30, 2025, a year-over-year increase of 15%. Its profits totaled $101.8 billion, up 16% year over year. Those numbers reflect strong growth for a $3.8 trillion business. Some might fret that Microsoft is overly dependent on OpenAI. But with the tremendous popularity of ChatGPT and GPT-5, in particular, the relationship with OpenAI is a big plus for the company. Importantly, though, the software giant has expanded its AI partnerships by offering Anthropic's Claude large language models (LLMs) to Microsoft Copilot Studio. I believe that agentic AI, which can automate processes performed by humans, holds enormous potential for Microsoft. We're only in the early innings of the adoption of agentic AI. I also think that Microsoft could be a big player in quantum computing, a technology that could transform multiple industries and pave the way for more powerful AI systems. In my opinion, Griffin was smart to buy Microsoft stock when he did. Wall Street is right to be bullish about this tech stock, too. Microsoft remains a great pick for long-term investors."

It dominates the PC software market with more than 80% of the market share for operating systems and also provides various market-leading business and productivity software. With a market cap of $3.9 trillion, Microsoft operates in 190+ countries across the globe. The software giant is set to announce its first-quarter results after the markets close on Wednesday, Oct. 29. Ahead of the event, analysts expect MSFT to report a profit of $3.66 per share, up 10.9% from $3.30 per share reported in the year-ago quarter. Furthermore, the company has surpassed Wall Street’s bottom-line estimates in each of the past four quarters.

While in fiscal 2027, its earnings are expected to surge 16% year-over-year to $17.88 per share. MSFT stock prices have soared 26.6% over the past 52 weeks, marginally lagging behind the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLK) 27.5% surge and notably outperforming the S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) 17.4% gains during the same time frame. Microsoft’s stock prices gained nearly 4% in the trading session following the release of its impressive Q4 results on Jul. 30. Driven by solid contributions from Cloud, Microsoft 365 Commercial products, and other businesses, the company’s overall topline for the quarter soared 18.1% year-over-year to $76.4 billion, beating the consensus estimates by 3.7%. Although Microsoft observed a slight drop in gross margins, its operating expenses as a percentage of revenues observed a notable decline. This led to a massive 23.6% surge in net income to $27.2 billion, and the company’s EPS of $3.65 surpassed the Street’s expectations by 9%. The consensus view on MSFT remains highly optimistic, with a “Strong Buy” rating overall. Of the 48 analysts covering the stock, opinions include 40 “Strong Buys,” five “Moderate Buys,” and three “Holds.” Its mean price target of $627.15 suggests a 19.5% upside potential from current price levels.

The momentum behind this surge stems from its solid financial performance, driven by robust demand for its cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. Both these areas have become key growth engines for Microsoft’s business and are likely to drive MSFT’s long-term growth. Microsoft Cloud generated over $168 billion in annual revenue in fiscal 2025, marking a 23% year-over-year increase. Within that, Azure generated more than $75 billion, representing a 34% increase. This growth reflects the expanding adoption of enterprises and rising demand across all types of workloads, from data storage to AI-powered computing.

Microsoft’s Growth Trajectory Shows Strong Momentum Microsoft’s growth trajectory remains solid as the tech giant continues to see solid demand for its cloud computing and AI solutions. Its commercial bookings surpassed the $100 billion mark during the last reported quarter, driven by robust contract renewals and an increase in multiple large-value deals, including several exceeding $10 million and even $100 million across Azure and Microsoft 365. MSFT’s commercial remaining performance obligation (RPO), a forward-looking indicator of revenue, climbed to $368 billion in the last reported quarter, reflecting a 37% year-over-year increase. Notably, approximately 35% of this RPO is expected to translate into revenue over the next 12 months. Furthermore, the remainder is expected to be recognized in subsequent periods, indicating a stable revenue runway extending well into the future."

Its Windows operating system is used in over 70% of desktop PCs. Millions of people use Microsoft's productivity software. Microsoft Azure is the second-largest cloud services provider. The company now trails only Nvidia (NVDA 0.86%) in market cap. It's one of the biggest beneficiaries of a massive artificial intelligence (AI) tailwind. Is investing in this top AI stock free money? It might be easy to jump to that conclusion. However, I wouldn't go that far. But while investing in Microsoft stock isn't free money, I think it's a smart money move. Microsoft's appeal It's not an exaggeration to say that Microsoft is a financial fortress. The tech giant generated a whopping $281.7 billion and earnings of $101.8 billion in fiscal year 2025, which ended June 30, 2025. Both the top and bottom lines increased by 15% year over year. Microsoft isn't just huge, it's nimble. What's driving this impressive growth? In large part, AI. In my view, Microsoft made a brilliant move a few years ago by investing in and partnering with OpenAI. Today, the company has OpenAI's GPT-5 large language model (LLM) integrated throughout its product lineup. This integration is paying off handsomely. The demand for anything and everything AI-related has provided a huge catalyst for Microsoft's cloud services. In its latest quarter, the company's Intelligent Cloud segment (which includes Azure) revenue soared 26% year over year. Microsoft is also staking a claim in one of the most exciting new opportunities -- quantum computing. Earlier this year, the company introduced its Majorana 1 quantum chip powered by a new type of material called a topoconductor. Microsoft believes that its topoconductor architecture could enable squeezing 1 million qubits (the basic unit of information in quantum computing) on a single chip. This could pave the way for large-scale quantum computers that can be used in a wide variety of applications. A Wall Street darling Microsoft's share price has more than doubled over the last three years. Its stock is up over 20% in 2025. Wall Street thinks there's more room to run. The consensus 12-month price target for Microsoft reflects an upside potential of roughly 19%. Several analysts with the most recent updates are even more bullish. For example, Morgan Stanley (MS -0.81%) projects that Microsoft's stock will climb 21%. Stifel's (SF 1.72%) price target is more than 25% above Microsoft's current share price. What's especially impressive to me is how widespread the positive sentiment about Microsoft is on Wall Street. Of the 58 analysts surveyed by S&P Global (SPGI 0.35%) in October, 13 rated the stock as a ""strong buy."" Another 44 analysts rated Microsoft as a ""buy."" The sole outlier recommending holding the stock. It's not surprising that Wall Street likes large-cap AI stocks right now. However, the enthusiasm over Microsoft is remarkable. Smart money, not free money I agree with the vast majority of analysts that buying Microsoft is a smart money move right now. The company's growth prospects remain strong, in my view. But investing in Microsoft is emphatically not free money. Why? Two reasons especially stand out. First, AI infrastructure spending could slow down. Much of Microsoft's surging revenue and profits has been a direct result of customers investing heavily in developing AI applications on Azure. However, some warn that we're in an AI bubble. That list includes OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Amazon (AMZN -0.61%) founder Jeff Bezos. Second, Microsoft's valuation is admittedly steep. The stock's forward price-to-earnings ratio is over 33. Any hiccup in growth could cause Microsoft's shares to tumble at that premium multiple. Investing in stocks (or anything else, for that matter) always comes with risks. The question that investors must determine is whether or not the potential rewards make those risks worth taking. In Microsoft's case, I think the answer is a resounding ""yes."""

",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-stock-buy-sell-hold-160141387.html,finance.yahoo.com,20250925T030000Z,semi,0.65,"Around since the 70s, and after operating for almost half a century, Oracle (ORCL) finds itself under some serious spotlight, thankfully for the right reasons. Following a blockbuster guidance that elevated founder Larry Ellison briefly to the status of the world's richest person, it is now in the news for a management revamp that is seldom seen among corporations. Will Two Be Better Than One? Through a press release on Sept. 22, the cloud computing major announced that Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia would be appointed as co-CEOs of the company, with current CEO Safra Katz set to serve as executive vice chair of the Oracle board of directors. Magouyrk joined Oracle in 2014 and most recently served as president of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). He played a pivotal role as one of the original architects of Oracle’s cloud engineering group, guiding the creation, rollout, and commercial success of OCI’s second generation, a platform designed to support both large-scale public cloud operations and massive AI training data centers measured in gigawatts. Sicilia, on the other hand, offers extensive experience in industry-specific software and applied AI. Under his leadership, engineering groups introduced intent-driven application generation, reducing reliance on conventional coding for Oracle’s application development. They also embedded advanced AI agents across Oracle’s vertical application suites—spanning healthcare, financial services, communications, utilities, hospitality, and retail. Notably, he joined the company in 2008, following Oracle's acquisition of Primavera Systems, where he served as CTO. Commenting on the development, Chairman of the Board Larry Ellison said: “Clay's years of experience leading Oracle's large, fast-growing Cloud Infrastructure business has demonstrated his readiness for a CEO role. Mike has spent the last several years modernizing Oracle's Industry applications businesses—including Oracle Health—by completely rebuilding those applications using the latest AI technologies. A few years ago, Clay and Mike committed Oracle's Infrastructure and Applications businesses to AI—it's paying off. They are both proven leaders, and I am looking forward to spending the coming years working side-by-side with them. Oracle's future is bright.” Meanwhile, the latest appointments of Magouyrk and Sicilia make it clear where Oracle's strategic focus lies—cloud and AI, specifically agentic AI. While Magouyrk's deep cloud expertise and prior stint at Amazon Web Services (AWS) are expected to push Oracle to challenge the hegemony of AWS, Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure, and Google Cloud in the cloud market, Sicilia's proven track record in the realm of applied AI fits in well with the company's aim of becoming an agentic AI powerhouse. So, what does this management change mean for the ORCL stock as an investment? Already up a mammoth 86% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, does the $877.1 billion market cap company have enough legs for another upmove? Let's analyze. Decent Financials But Overhyped The most recent trigger for the Oracle share price was the company's guidance that it expects its revenues from the cloud business to grow by a significant 77% in this fiscal year to $77 billion. However, a deeper dive would reveal that its numbers were nothing extraordinary. In fact, it was rather muted, with both revenue and earnings missing estimates. For its fiscal Q1 results, Oracle revealed that the revenues increased by 12.2% from the previous year to $14.9 billion. The largest revenue segment of cloud saw quarterly revenues of $7.2 billion, up 27.8% on a year-over-year (YOY) basis, as all other segments witnessed growth as well, except for software ($5.7 billion, -1% YOY). Earnings saw a modest yearly growth of 5.8% to come in at $1.47 per share, missing the consensus estimate of $1.48 by a whisker. Notably, over the last nine quarters, Oracle's earnings have had a mixed showing with four misses and five beats. Over a much longer period of 10 years, however, Oracle's performance has been disappointing, with revenue and earnings growing at CAGRs of just 4.48% and 2.73%, respectively. A transition from up-front license sales to a cloud/subscription revenue recognition model and a late thrust towards AI and cloud infrastructure are to blame. Coming back to the latest results, what can be seen as a prominent cause of optimism around Oracle for the coming years and which can increase its rate of revenue growth, which has been evidently abysmal, is its remaining performance obligations, or RPO figure. The company informed investors that in the quarter, Oracle saw its RPO jump by a scarcely believable 359% to $455 billion. This is significant, as RPO represents the total value of signed contracts for goods or services that Oracle is obligated to deliver in the future. Thus, this bodes well for the company, as a large RPO means Oracle has a pipeline of committed income that will hit the books over time. Net cash from operating activities for the quarter rose to $8.14 billion from $7.43 billion in the same period a year ago. Overall, Oracle closed the quarter with a cash balance of $10.44 billion. Although this may seem significant, the company's short-term debt is close to that figure at $9.08 billion. Looking Into The Oracle So, Oracle's has been almost a lost decade, as can be seen above. Yet, within that period, the stock has shot up by nine times, as the shift in the revenue recognition model mentioned earlier may have hurt sales growth in the initial years, but it has created a base for strong and predictable cash flows in the future. Moreover, significant share buybacks have also played a part in the appreciation of the stock price. And if Oracle plays its strategy correctly, the company’s outlook appears promising, supported by its growing leadership in AI infrastructure, significant multi-billion-dollar contracts, unique multi-cloud partnerships, and rapid expansion in GPU capacity and innovation, though challenges remain in the form of intense competition and valuation scrutiny. A central pillar of this growth trajectory is Oracle’s confirmed multi-year cloud agreement with OpenAI, valued at over $300 billion and set to commence in the coming years. OpenAI’s selection of Oracle was influenced not only by the company’s substantial computing capacity but also by its cost efficiency and execution speed. Notably, Oracle has also become an early adopter of Nvidia’s (NVDA) Blackwell GPUs, integrating Nvidia’s full CUDA ecosystem into Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, while simultaneously scaling up with thousands of AMD (AMD) MI300X chips to provide customers with enhanced flexibility and competitive cost advantages. Beyond OpenAI, Oracle is reportedly in advanced discussions with Meta (META) regarding a potential $20 billion cloud arrangement to supply AI training capabilities, further challenging traditional hyperscalers. The company’s approach to multi-cloud integration has also evolved strategically. Oracle is now enabling Oracle Database@Azure and connecting with both Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud, allowing enterprises to deploy Oracle tools seamlessly across multiple platforms. This strategy has yielded tangible results, with revenues from these collaborations increasing sixteenfold in the first quarter. Innovation continues to be a key focus, exemplified by the launch of Database 23c “AI,” which incorporates native vector search to enhance machine learning efficiency. In parallel, Oracle’s AI Agent Studio allows enterprises to develop LLM-powered agents using technologies like Meta’s Llama or Cohere, streamlining operations across HR, finance, and other functions. Oracle also finds itself at the intersection of geopolitics and social media through Project Texas and its involvement with TikTok. With U.S. regulators pressing ByteDance to divest TikTok’s U.S. operations, Oracle already hosts and secures over 100 million U.S. user accounts on its cloud infrastructure, positioning the company as a strategic participant in any potential acquisition. Larry Ellison’s political connections further reinforce Oracle’s potential role in a forced sale scenario. Acquisition of TikTok could elevate Oracle into a major consumer social media player, tapping into over 115 million U.S. monthly active users and unlocking opportunities for data monetization, advertising revenue, and cultural influence. Finally, Ellison emphasizes AI inference over training as a primary driver of future growth, alongside cloud expansion. Oracle’s technical advantages, including lower latency, higher throughput, and cost efficiency, support this focus, reinforcing its strategic positioning in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. However, much larger and deep-pocketed hyperscalers such as Microsoft, Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) will certainly not leave the ground so easily for Oracle. Moreover, despite being around for decades, Oracle is still not the first choice when it comes to cloud for enterprises as much as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud is. Then there is the issue of valuation. Oracle's searing rally has come at the cost of its valuations reaching uncomfortable levels. Currently, the ORCL stock is trading at a forward P/E, P/S, and P/CF of 62.99, 13.08, and 35.45, much higher than the sector medians of 33.14, 3.51, and 19.17, respectively. Even with an upbeat growth outlook, the stock is trading at a much higher PEG of 2.97, where the sector median is 1.87. Analyst Opinion on ORCL Stock Overall, analysts are bullish about the ORCL stock, with a “Strong Buy” rating earmarked. The price target of $334.57 denotes an upside potential of about 2% from current levels. Out of 37 analysts covering the stock, 26 have a “Strong Buy” rating, one has a “Moderate Buy” rating, and 10 have a “Hold” rating.

He draws parallels between today's AI adoption rate of 25% and the early internet in 1996, when markets continued rallying for years after Alan Greenspan's famous ""irrational exuberance"" warning. More News from Barchart Current sentiment and gains lag far behind dot-com extremes, and this perhaps suggests more upside is on the table. Evercore advises investors to focus on the ""Magnificent Seven"" AI leaders by using options for asymmetric upside while expecting volatility similar to the 1990s technology boom. Here are the three top names: Amazon (AMZN) Amazon (AMZN) currently owns the largest cloud computing division, which is Amazon Web Services (AWS). Q2 AWS revenue grew 17.5% year-over-year (YoY) to $30.9 billion. It is constituting a larger and larger share of the total business. There has been intensifying competition from Azure and Google Cloud, but there is enough momentum in the AI market to keep AWS growing. A rising tide in AI is likely to lift all ""boats"" in the cloud computing industry. It's not just AWS that can cause AMZN stock to surge. The company is investing in Anthropic, which is one of the premier private AI LLM companies. Anthropic's AI products are widely considered to be the most cutting-edge for coding purposes. Analysts have a mean price target of $265.19. Of 55 analysts, none have a ""Sell"" rating, with 47 ""Strong Buy"" ratings, six ""Moderate Buy"" ratings, and two ""Hold"" ratings. The price target implies 16.5% upside. Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft (MSFT) is the company that indirectly began the current AI revolution with its prudent investments into OpenAI before ChatGPT was even released. Its first investment into OpenAI was back in 2019, with a $1 billion investment that was followed by a massive $10 billion in 2023."

After all, they are the two biggest AI markets, and companies from these countries -- such as the U.S.' Nvidia and China's Huawei -- have stood out for their innovations. But other countries also represent growth opportunities for AI players, and one in particular is the U.K. In fact, the U.K. is the third-largest AI market today, with a value of $92 billion as of last year, according to the government. And two U.S. companies in particular will benefit the most from a recent $42 billion AI infrastructure push in that country. I'm talking about cloud computing giants Microsoft (MSFT 0.50%) and Amazon (AMZN -0.61%). Let's take a closer look at this potentially explosive growth story. Microsoft's $30 billion investment Just last week, Microsoft and other U.S. players including Nvidia and Salesforce announced investments in the U.K. totaling $42 billion. Microsoft pledged to invest $30 billion in the country by 2028, and that includes an infrastructure buildout to support its creation of the U.K.'s biggest supercomputer. This would involve more than 23,000 graphics processing units (GPUs), or the chips supporting the most crucial of AI tasks such as the training and inferencing of large language models. This follows news from a few months ago: Then, Amazon announced it would spend more than $54 billion over the coming three years to boost its cloud computing and AI infrastructure in the U.K. -- and invest in new fulfillment centers to support its e-commerce business in the country. So, U.S. companies clearly see the potential for growth in the U.K. and have committed to it at just the right moment, as the momentum for AI infrastructure buildout picks up. Nvidia chief Jensen Huang recently predicted global AI infrastructure spending will reach a mind-boggling $4 trillion by the end of the decade. Among all of the companies involved in the U.K. buildout, though, Microsoft and Amazon may benefit the most, and here's why. One key element is these companies both are leaders in the world of cloud computing. Amazon's Amazon Web Services (AWS) holds the biggest share at about 30% of the market worldwide, while Microsoft Azure holds 20%. And specifically in the U.K. market, each of these players holds about a 40% share, putting them on equal footing. This leadership positions them well as demand for AI capacity grows -- current Azure and AWS customers may stick with these cloud providers that they know well for their AI workloads. The ability to ramp up quickly These players also have the financial strength and presence on site to quickly ramp up and follow through on their investment plans, which means they might be ready to meet this growing demand in the U.K. market. So, as the U.K. and its businesses focus on AI, Microsoft and Amazon should see their cloud revenues in the country take off. What does all of this mean for you as an investor? Should you buy shares of these players because of this potential growth in the U.K.? I wouldn't invest in these stocks for this reason only -- but it represents a positive point to add to an already strong buy case. Each of these players trades at interesting levels today, particularly Amazon, which has seen its valuation decline considerably from late last year. MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts Meanwhile, these players are highly profitable and have delivered a strong track record of revenue and net income growth over the past several years. MSFT Net Income (Annual) data by YCharts The AI opportunity ahead now offers these well-established companies that have proven themselves over time a new growth driver. And since they're leaders in the cloud market, as mentioned, they're well positioned to benefit significantly -- especially in a market where they dominate, such as in the U.K. All of this means that now makes an excellent time for both cautious and aggressive investors to buy shares of these current and future winners -- they're set to gain from the AI boom at home, in the U.K., and potentially in other parts of the world as well."

The company has identified cloud expansion as the driver of its next growth phase, alongside the aggressive venture into multicloud expansion. The company is also incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into its cloud stack. Amid all this, the company is expected to report its first-quarter results for fiscal 2026 today, Sept. 9, after the market closes. Oracle, based in Austin, Texas, is a prominent player in the global tech industry, known for its enterprise software and cloud services. The company designs and delivers database technologies, cloud infrastructure, and a wide range of business applications. Oracle's solutions encompass its flagship database systems and cloud platforms, including Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), which provides support for computing, storage, networking, and AI tools. It also offers cloud-based applications for enterprise resource planning (ERP), human capital management (HCM), and customer experience (CX). Serving organizations across diverse sectors, Oracle helps companies streamline operations and embrace digital innovation. With a strong focus on security, scalability, and performance, Oracle remains a key driver in modernizing IT systems worldwide. The company has a market capitalization of $653.90 billion. Based on solid demand for AI-fueled cloud infrastructure, ORCL stock has been growing robustly. Over the past 52 weeks, the stock has gained 68.6%, while it is up by 41.5% year-to-date (YTD). It had reached a 52-week high of $260.87 in July but is down 9.6% from this high. Oracle’s valuation is comparatively stretched at the moment. Its price sits at 53.64 times its earnings, which is higher than the industrial average of 29.20 times. Oracle Topped Estimates In Its Last Reported Quarter On June 11, Oracle reported solid growth in its results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 (the quarter that ended May 31). The company’s total revenue increased 11% year-over-year (YoY) to $15.9 billion. This was also higher than the $15.6 billion that Wall Street analysts were expecting. At the heart of this growth was Oracle’s cloud services and license support segment, which recorded topline growth of 14% from the prior year’s period, reaching $11.70 billion. Oracle also reported expansion in its multicloud operations. Its multicloud database revenue from Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) and Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure grew 115% sequentially from Q3 to Q4. On top of it, revenue from Oracle Cloud@Customer data centers grew 104% YoY. On aggregate, Oracle cloud infrastructure consumption revenue grew 62% in the fiscal fourth quarter. The company’s profitability is also growing. In Q4, its adjusted operating income was $7.04 billion, a 5% increase from the year-ago value. Its adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.70, which also grew 4% YoY, and was greater than the $1.64 figure that Wall Street analysts were expecting. Oracle has high hopes for the current fiscal year, with management expecting fiscal 2026 to show higher revenue growth. The company’s total cloud growth is expected to increase from 24% in FY2025 to over 40% in FY2026. The growth rate of cloud infrastructure is likely to rise from 50% to over 70%, while RPO is projected to grow by more than 100% in the current fiscal year. Wall Street analysts are optimistic about Oracle’s future earnings. For the current fiscal year, EPS is projected to increase 20.7% annually to $5.31, followed by a 13.8% growth to $6.04 in the next fiscal year. On the other hand, for Q1 of FY2026 (which is set to be reported on Sept. 9 after the market closes), the company’s EPS is expected to drop modestly by 2.5% YoY to $1.15. What Do Analysts Think About ORCL Stock? Wall Street analysts are bullish on the growth prospects for ORCL stock. In August, analysts at Mizuho maintained their “Outperform” rating on the stock, while raising the price target from $245 to $300. Mizuho analysts cited the company’s market position as a “structural AI winner” at the beginning stages of the enterprise AI revolution, which is picking up pace. In the same month, analysts at TD Cowen maintained their “Buy” rating on Oracle’s shares while raising the price target from $275 to $325, indicating bullish sentiments regarding the stock. Citing Oracle’s ongoing cloud transition and the company’s prospects as a hyperscaler, analysts at Bernstein SocGen Group maintained their “Outperform” rating on the stock while raising the price target from $269 to $308. Oracle is a popular name on Wall Street, with analysts awarding it a consensus “Moderate Buy” rating overall. Of the 37 analysts rating the stock, 25 of them have rated it a “Strong Buy,” one analyst suggests a “Moderate Buy,” and 11 analysts are playing it safe with a “Hold” rating. The consensus price target of $251.97 represents an 8.2% upside from current levels. However, the Street-high TD Cowen-given price target of $325 indicates a 39.6% upside.

",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-stock-buy-sell-hold-130002055.html,finance.yahoo.com,20250905T213000Z,semi,0.65,"Chinese multinational technology company Alibaba (BABA) built its empire on e-commerce dominance, reshaping how China shops online. But 2025 has not been a straight climb for BABA stock. After peaking in mid-March, shares stalled, weighed down by trade tensions, U.S. restrictions on artificial intelligence (AI) chip exports, and lingering questions about China’s economy. Then came Q1 — and a sharp turn. Alibaba stock soared 13% after blowout cloud results and growing excitement around the firm's new custom AI chip, designed to bypass Nvidia (NVDA) curbs and power a wave of innovation. Add to that Alibaba's aggressive bets on China’s cutthroat “instant commerce” market, and investors are finally warming up again. With cloud growth accelerating and AI ambitions expanding, BABA stock is now trading at its highest levels since March. But with September here, is the stock your next big buy? Or is it time to cash out? About Alibaba Stock Alibaba has transformed into a tech titan, reshaping China’s digital landscape, now valued at a market capitalization of $330 billion. Founded by Jack Ma in 1999, the company now dominates e-commerce through Taobao, Tmall, and Alibaba.com while expanding into cloud computing, AI, fintech via Ant Group, and logistics through Cainiao. Alibaba's bets on AI infrastructure and “instant commerce” are redefining its edge, placing it firmly among global tech heavyweights. After years of regulatory turbulence, the company’s resurgence is drawing fresh investor attention worldwide. That resurgence is playing out in BABA stock's price action. Starting 2025 in the $80 range in January, the stock rocketed to a 52-week peak of $148.43 by March before sliding to $95.73 in April. But momentum is back. Up 61% year-to-date (YTD) and returning 66% over the past 52 weeks, BABA stock closed at $135 after a 13% jump on Aug. 29, fueled by blowout first-quarter cloud results and excitement over its custom AI chip. Trading volume spiked to 82.17 million while the 14-day RSI climbed to 67.93, flashing bullish momentum. Investors are betting on Alibaba’s AI-powered growth story — and September could be the real test. Alibaba is priced at just 17.2 times forward earnings, trading below the industry median. With analysts projecting double-digit profit growth next fiscal year, this discount looks less like weakness and more like a rare entry point before the market wakes up to BABA’s upside. Alibaba Jumps Despite Mixed Q1 Report On Aug. 29, Alibaba dropped its Q1 earnings, and the market reaction was anything but boring. Shares of the Chinese tech giant gapped higher, even though the results were a mixed bag. For the quarter, adjusted earnings fell 10% year-over-year (YOY) to RMB 14.75 per American depositary share (ADS), missing forecasts. Revenue climbed a modest 2% to RMB 247.65 billion ($34.6 billion) — also shy of estimates. On the surface, it looked underwhelming. But things get interesting: net income skyrocketed 78%, thanks to gains from equity investments and the disposal of its stake in Turkish e-commerce firm Trendyol. Investors love profits, even when they come from clever maneuvers. The real star of the quarter was Cloud Intelligence. Revenue there surged 26% YOY to RMB 33.4 billion ($4.7 billion), beating expectations and accelerating from the previous quarter’s growth. Alibaba credited AI adoption for the boost, signaling that it wants to be China’s Microsoft (MSFT) or Alphabet (GOOGL) in the AI race. The company reported triple-digit growth in AI-related products for the eighth-straight quarter and pledged to spend $50 billion over the next three years on AI infrastructure. CEO Eddie Wu called AI a “significant” driver for cloud revenue going forward. E-commerce, accounting for over 50% of Alibaba’s revenue, delivered mixed results. China's e-commerce revenue rose 10% to RMB 140.1 billion ($19.5 billion), while the international unit jumped 19%, driven by AliExpress and other platforms. However, adjusted earnings in the core commerce division fell 21%, due to heavy investments in instant commerce — Alibaba’s bold bet on delivering products within an hour via Taobao. Competition here is brutal, with Meituan (MPNGY) and JD.com (JD) in the ring, but Alibaba’s management sees this as a trillion-yuan gross merchandise value (GMV) opportunity in three years. Alibaba is not just betting on cloud growth — it is building its own AI chip to sidestep U.S. restrictions on Nvidia’s high-end processors. With Washington tightening export curbs and Beijing quietly urging companies not to buy even Nvidia’s older models, Alibaba’s move feels like both defense and offense. The chip, still in testing, is designed for a wide range of AI tasks, from training large models to powering retail operations. It ties directly into Alibaba’s Qwen AI models and its larger push to weave AI across e-commerce and cloud. For China’s largest cloud provider, developing homegrown chips could ease geopolitical headwinds, reduce dependency on foreign tech, and sharpen its competitive edge in the AI arms race. Analysts tracking Alibaba expect its earnings path to look like a dip before a rebound. Fiscal 2026 profits are projected to dip 5% YOY to $7.83 per share, then climb by 25% to $9.81 per share in fiscal 2027. What Do Analysts Expect for Alibaba Stock? Wall Street is turning bullish on Alibaba after Q1, with analysts hiking price targets on confidence in its cloud growth and expanding AI ambitions. CFRA kept a “Buy” rating, with analyst Angelo Zino stating that Alibaba’s investments in quick commerce and AI are reshaping its operations and positioning it for long-term gains. Meanwhile, BofA Securities also lifted its price target to $152 from $135, citing triple-digit AI revenue growth for eight consecutive quarters and rising cloud investments. With management committing RMB 380 billion in AI and cloud infrastructure over three years, analysts see Alibaba carving out a powerful role in the GenAI race while strengthening its global commerce play. Goldman Sachs analyst Ronald Keung bumped his target to $163 and maintained a “Buy” rating, noting bigger near-term losses in September but expecting them to shrink by year-end as Alibaba focuses on higher-quality users, trims subsidies, and sharpens delivery efficiency. Keung sees the company evolving into an “AI + everyday consumption app” and an “AI + Cloud hyperscaler.” JPMorgan analyst Alex Yao went even further, hiking his target to $170 from $140 and keeping an “Overweight” rating, arguing Alibaba’s food delivery and instant commerce arms are now operating at scale. Meanwhile, Bernstein analyst Robin Zhu lifted his target to $160 and kept an “Outperform” rating, impressed by Alibaba’s user figures. Zhu expects food delivery losses to be halved by October, calling Q2 the spending peak before momentum shifts profitably. Overall, analysts are upbeat, with BABA stock currently having a “Strong Buy"" rating overall. Of the 22 analysts covering the stock, 19 suggest a “Strong Buy,” one advises a “Moderate Buy,” one recommends a “Hold,” and one has a “Strong Sell.” The mean price target of $162.28 suggests the stock could surge by 19% from current price levels. The Street-high target of $195 represents potential upside of 43%.

",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-takes-aim-openai-buy-201213844.html,finance.yahoo.com,20250904T071500Z,semi,0.65,"A key aspect of Microsoft's (MSFT) position as a prominent player in the fiercely competitive but fast-growing space of artificial intelligence (AI) is its $13 billion investment in OpenAI, the little-known startup that captured the imagination of the world and made AI mainstream at the end of 2022. Having a 49% stake in the profits of the company, a valuation that has soared above $300 billion, and integration in various forms across its line of products, Microsoft's investment in OpenAI has been a success. Then, why is Microsoft looking to upend the applecart by developing its own AI models? Microsoft is testing two of its own in-house developed AI models, namely MAI-Voice-1 and MAI-Voice-Preview. While the MAI-Voice-1 is Microsoft’s first in-house AI speech generation model, designed for natural, expressive voice output used for narrated news, podcasts, and Copilot voice features, the MAI-1-preview is Microsoft's first fully in-house foundation model, built using a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture, to be used as a general-purpose AI assistant for text tasks—like answering questions, summarizing, writing, coding help, and reasoning. Neither of the models is available for use on a large scale for the public, with MAI-Voice-1 accessible to the public inside specific Microsoft products like Copilot Daily and certain Labs features. And the MAI-1-Preview is available to public testers via LMArena and a small set of Copilot text features. Speaking about Microsoft's plans for the future in terms of model development, the CEO of Microsoft's AI unit, Mustafa Suleyman, had this to say: “We have big ambitions for where we go next — model advancements, an exciting roadmap of compute, and the chance to reach billions of people through Microsoft’s products.” On the other hand, OpenAI is also not just being a mute spectator, as it is reducing its own dependence on Microsoft by forming alliances with rivals such as Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) and Apple (AAPL). However, amid all these changing scenarios and forming and breaking partnerships in the fast-changing world of AI, should Microsoft remain an investor's favorite? I reckon so, and here's why. Superb Quarterly Results (Again) Microsoft's results for the most recent quarter were marked by a beat on both the revenue and earnings fronts. This marked the ninth consecutive quarter of earnings beat from the company. This is no mean feat, and due to the regular nature of its occurrence for Microsoft, it is perhaps an aspect of the company that is a bit underappreciated. Microsoft's revenues for the fiscal Q4 2025 quarter stood at $76.4 billion, up 18% from the previous year, as all the segments witnessed growth. Unsurprisingly, the cloud segment saw the highest year-over-year (YoY) growth at 25.6% to come in at $29.9 billion, with Azure clocking an even sharper growth rate of 39%. Meanwhile, earnings surged by 23.7% yearly to $3.65 per share, comfortably outpacing the consensus estimate of $3.38 per share. Notably, this marked the fourth straight quarter of double-digit YoY earnings growth from the company. Operating margins improved as well to 44.9% from 43.1% in the year-ago period, a testament to its competitive strength. Growth in revenue and earnings was accompanied by an increase in net cash from operations to $42.6 billion, compared to $37.2 billion in the year-ago period, as the company closed the quarter with a mammoth cash balance of $94.6 billion, with no short-term debt on the company's books. Thus, analysts are also predicting Microsoft to report industry-beating growth in revenue and earnings, with the forward revenue and earnings growth rates forecasted to be 14.72% and 15.45%, higher than the sector medians of 7.47% and 10.91%, respectively. This opens up room for further upside of the MSFT stock, which is already up 19.5% on a YTD basis. Notably, Microsoft, with a market cap of about $3.8 trillion, is currently the second most valuable company in the world in terms of market cap. Cloud, AI, and Beyond As highlighted in my last piece for Microsoft, the Redmond, WA-based company is not solely dependent on the AI revolution (as powerful as it is) for its upward trajectory. There is much more to stay excited about with Microsoft. Azure remains the cornerstone of Microsoft’s growth story. It delivers a broad spectrum of capabilities, from computing power and data storage to networking, analytics, and artificial intelligence. In recent years, the company has expanded this platform with Azure AI Foundry, a framework built to help customers create, refine, and operate AI-based applications and agents at scale. Microsoft has also positioned itself among the earliest movers in large-scale AI infrastructure. It is building gigawatt-class data centers equipped with liquid cooling, a technology designed to handle the immense energy and processing demands of advanced AI. This push is reinforced by its position as a full-stack AI provider, giving it the advantage of controlling both the infrastructure and the software layers. Its main large language models, developed in partnership with OpenAI under the GPT family, are continually upgraded to deliver better performance and more sophisticated capabilities. Beyond cloud infrastructure, the company is capturing strong adoption with Copilot and GitHub. Copilot alone sees around 100 million active users every month, while its wider features reach over 800 million people. By embedding it directly into productivity tools such as Word, Excel, Outlook, Teams, and Windows, Microsoft is steadily reinforcing its position in the AI interface space—where everyday user interaction meets intelligent assistance. GitHub, which it owns, is already the world’s largest collaborative coding environment, hosting over 500 million open-source projects and engaging more than 100 million developers. The introduction of GitHub Copilot is accelerating its evolution into a development platform built with AI at its core. Acting as a programming assistant, it can produce routine code quickly while also helping developers structure complex solutions more efficiently. Lastly, the company is not limiting its innovation to conventional cloud computing. On Nov. 19, 2024, it announced a partnership with Atom Computing to bring the Azure Quantum compute platform to market. This was followed by a breakthrough in July 2025, when Microsoft successfully achieved the first operational deployment of a Level 2 quantum computer, an important step toward making quantum computing a viable commercial reality. Analyst Opinion on MSFT Stock Thus, analysts have deemed the MSFT stock to be a “Strong Buy,” with a mean target price of $622.85. This indicates an upside potential of about 23% from current levels. Out of 47 analysts covering the stock, 39 have a “Strong Buy” rating, five have a “Moderate Buy” rating, and three have a “Hold” rating.

Shares of Meta are up 32% on a YTD basis, and it boasts a market cap of about $1.8 trillion. Meta Posts a Blowout Q2 Meta’s spending spree on high-profile hires and capex rollout to build its AI capabilities would make one think that it is coming at the expense of the company’s financials. The reality is far from that. In the past 10 years, Meta’s revenue and earnings have compounded at annual growth rates of 28.85% and 37.25%, respectively. Moreover, it has reported an earnings beat in each of the past nine quarters, including the latest Q2. In Q2 2025, Meta reported revenues of $47.5 billion, up 22% from the previous year. Core advertising revenues continued to drive overall topline growth, coming in at $46.6 billion, which marked a yearly rise of 21.5%. Earnings witnessed an even sharper yearly growth of 38% to $7.14 per share, well ahead of the consensus estimate of $5.92 per share. Encouragingly, operating margins improved as well to 43% from 38% in the year-ago period. Daily active people (DAP) and average price per ad rose by 6% to 3.48 billion and 9%, respectively. Net cash from operating activities increased by 32% from the previous year to $25.6 billion. However, free cash flow dropped to $8.55 billion from $10.9 billion in the prior year. The decline in cash flows should not be seen as a negative, instead it is transient and is a sign of the company’s huge spending on data center infrastructure and hiring, which will ultimately drive growth in the future."

Stock indexes settled mixed on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average recovering from a one-month low. Stocks were pressured on Tuesday as the US-China trade conflict escalated further after China sanctioned five US units of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean Co., in the latest in a series of tit-for-tat moves. Both countries have slapped special port fees on each other’s vessels. The moves have implications for the global economy, as vessels are responsible for moving more than 80% of international trade. Additionally, President Trump stated that he may halt trade in cooking oil from China as a retaliatory measure against China’s refusal to purchase US soybeans. Stock indexes recovered from their worst levels on Tuesday as bond yields declined on dovish comments from Fed Chair Powell, which reinforced expectations that the Fed will cut interest rates at the October 28-29 FOMC meeting. Fed Chair Powell said labor market perceptions remain on a downward trajectory and that the Fed may stop shrinking its balance sheet and end quantitative tightening in the coming months. The 10-year T-note yield fell -2 bp to 4.02%. Stocks also garnered support on Tuesday on AI optimism after Walmart rose more than 4% after it announced a partnership with OpenAI to enable shoppers to browse and purchase products on ChatGPT. The escalation of trade tensions has sparked buying of precious metals as a haven, as gold and silver rallied to new record highs on Tuesday. Also, global bond markets are the recipients of haven demand from the trade turmoil as bond yields declined worldwide. The 10-year German bund yield dropped to a 3.25-month low of 2.58% and the 10-year T-note yield fell to a 3.5-week low of 4.00%. Tuesday’s minor economic news showed that the US Sep NFIB small business optimism index fell -2.0 to 98.8, weaker than expectations of 100.6. Most stock indexes rallied to record highs last week on optimism that growth in the AI sector and spending on artificial intelligence will translate into corporate profits. Stocks are also underpinned by hopes that a resilient US economy and additional Fed easing will continue to support the economy. The shutdown of the US government continues, weighing on market sentiment and delaying key economic reports. The government shutdown means delays in the release of government reports, including the last two weeks of weekly initial unemployment claims, the Aug US trade report, and the Sep nonfarm payrolls report. Last Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said that it will release the September consumer price report on October 24 if the government shutdown continues into Wednesday, when the Sep CPI report is scheduled for release. The White House has warned that if the government shutdown lingered, it would trigger widespread dismissals of employees in government programs that don’t align with President Trump’s priorities. Bloomberg Economics estimates that 640,000 federal workers will be furloughed during the shutdown, which would expand jobless claims and push the unemployment rate up to 4.7%. The markets this week will focus on Q3 earnings results as the Q3 earnings season begins. Rising corporate earnings expectations are a bullish backdrop for stocks.

The escalation of the US-China trade conflict sparked safe-haven buying of government debt securities. Also, falling inflation expectations are supportive for T-notes after the 10-year breakeven inflation rate fell to a 3.25-month low on Tuesday at 2.299%. T-notes also have support amid concerns about the ongoing US government shutdown, which could lead to additional job losses, reduced consumer spending, and a weakened US economy, potentially allowing the Fed to continue cutting interest rates. European government bond yields moved lower on Tuesday. The 10-year German bund yield dropped to a 3.25-month low of 2.583% and finished down -2.6 bp at 2.610%.

At these higher valuations, picking new AI stocks is a bit trickier. But there are still opportunities in high-quality, defensive AI stocks, as well as laggard turnarounds that still have AI upside. The following two storied names embody both defensive and aggressive bets on the AI revolution today. Microsoft Microsoft (MSFT 0.50%) is a leader in enterprise software, cloud computing, and PC operating systems, along with other cash-generative businesses like LinkedIn and Xbox. Microsoft's diversified portfolio of profitable growth businesses gives it the cash flow to compete strongly in artificial intelligence. And while the generative AI boom is potentially disruptive to even the large tech giants, it's more likely the forward-thinking Microsoft and visionary CEO Satya Nadella will find ways to benefit from the AI transition. After all, Microsoft was an early investor in OpenAI, the leading AI model-builder, which in some ways is attempting to compete with Microsoft's enterprise software business. But even if that happens to an extent, Microsoft's stake in OpenAI would appreciate in value, somewhat offsetting the threat. Meanwhile, Microsoft has made a few bullish ""leaks"" of late. According to a recent Bloomberg piece citing anonymous internal sources, Microsoft management apparently believes its data center capacity will be constrained for longer than previously anticipated. Not having enough data center capacity to meet demand seems like a ""good"" problem to have, and suggests the growth outlook for Microsoft's Azure cloud unit should be strong for years. Meanwhile, another Microsoft executive recently hinted at something bigger perhaps bubbling under the surface -- Microsoft's in-house AI chip efforts. Microsoft is seen as somewhat of a laggard in designing its own in-house AI accelerators, something its rivals have been at for a longer time. In recent years, cloud giants have been designing their own silicon in order to wean themselves off higher-priced Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices graphics processing units (GPUs). However, Microsoft Chief Technology Officer Kevin Scott recently said Microsoft's goal is to use ""mainly"" its own chips going forward, adding that Microsoft is using ""lots of Microsoft"" silicon today. If Microsoft gets its in-house chip efforts on par with or better than rivals, look for its cloud and AI gross margins to increase even more. Intel While most AI-related chip stocks are at or near their all-time highs, Intel (INTC 0.47%) has been a notable laggard. The stock has recently doubled off its April lows, but Intel's stock still remains about 50% below all-time highs, and trades at a fraction of the market cap of other AI winners. But this summer, a turnaround began brewing, as Intel attracted the investment of the U.S. government, Softbank, and Nvidia, which all put billions of dollars behind the U.S. chipmaker. Perhaps more importantly, Intel just hosted journalists at its new high-tech semiconductor manufacturing plant, Fab 51, in Arizona last week. There, it introduced the first two products to be produced at the new fab: Panther Lake, a new PC CPU, and Clearwater Forest, the power-efficient data center CPU, which should start shipping in early 2026. The event was important, as it was the formal unveiling of Intel's all-important 18A node, the manufacturing node where Intel hopes to catch up to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing in process technology. The node features two new important innovations: gate-all-around (GAA) transistors and backside power. At the tour, Intel said 18A's current manufacturing defect density was at its lowest point in its development, and that the node would be ready for high-volume manufacturing before the year is out. That's extremely notable, as many in the press have downplayed 18A, with various outlets peddling rumors of low yields and questions over performance. But if Intel can achieve high-volume manufacturing this quarter at good yields, it will match TSMC's schedule for its 2nm-class chips, which should also begin high-volume manufacturing soon. And while TSMC chips will have GAA transistors, they won't have backside power. So it's possible for some applications, Intel may actually be ahead of TSMC in 2026. And Intel will certainly be ahead of TSMC in terms of U.S.-based chip manufacturing. Despite TSMC having pledged billions and billions to build U.S.-based fabs, it isn't anticipated to bring even its 3nm chip technology to the U.S. until 2027, let alone 2nm, which is supposed to arrive the following year. That means if there is geopolitical strife between China and Taiwan at any point over the next few years, Intel's importance would only grow -- perhaps exponentially. With the backing of the U.S. government and now potentially having a leading process once again, Intel is a turnaround story to bet on, even after its recent surge."

This could be a bullish signal from Benson about IBM, but it’s also objectively been a strong stock this year, putting up 20% gains year-to-date. The business is solid, with many new partnerships in the works with a variety of industries. Perhaps its strongest position, however, is in the AI space, where IBM has positioned itself as a leader in enterprise AI solutions. Unlike general purpose generative AI, or public facing LLMs, many of IBM’s AI solutions are targeted to specific clients or industries, especially those that are highly regulated. This helps the company keep a lid on costs, and has generated a considerable backlog for the product, ensuring interest for some time to come. Benson’s opening a position in IBM during Q3 could represent a strong conviction in the stock, but may also have been an opportunistic move, considering IBM experienced a major drop in share price during the quarter, which it has since recovered from.

And guess what? Almost no one is paying attention to it. Fair enough – even I had no idea until I did a little research. But trust me when I say that everyone should be talking about this. It all has to do with one sector I’ve been calling out throughout 2025 – quantum computing. For those of you not in the know, quantum represents one of the single biggest technological breakthroughs of this century. Quantum computing swaps out binary code for a system that uses quantum bits (or qubits) to power the most advanced applications on the planet. It’s the biggest shift away from classical computing we’ll ever see in our lifetime. And earlier this month, two researchers published a groundbreaking paper that demonstrates exactly how powerful quantum computing will soon become. The Dawn of the Quantum Age Those two researchers — Martín Larocca (a Los Alamos National Laboratory scientist) and Vojtěch Havlíček (a researcher at IBM) — successfully used a quantum algorithm to solve a century-old mathematical problem that even the most powerful, conventional supercomputers couldn’t handle. The tricky part of the problem had to do with “factoring group representations.” Don’t let that phrase scare you off. It’s basically math-speak for breaking down hidden patterns — like solving a puzzle. Why does that matter? Because these kinds of patterns show up everywhere — in the smallest particles that make up atoms, in the way crystals are structured, and even in the way your phone sends texts and videos. The pair used a tool that takes a messy, complicated wave or signal and splits it into clear, simple parts. Think of it like taking a song and pulling out the drums, the guitars, and the vocals so you can hear each one separately. By doing this, the team demonstrated what’s called “quantum advantage.” That’s where quantum computers solve a meaningful, real-world problem that traditional computers simply don’t handle quickly. This has tremendous potential to impact our everyday lives. The same method could help doctors scan the human body more clearly, improve the safety of nuclear energy, make internet data more reliable, or even design new medicines and stronger building materials. Most of the time, quantum computing gets hyped up for things it might do someday, but this study is different. Here we see that quantum computers already doing something important today. In my view, that’s the moment where this tech shifts from being just a cool science experiment to becoming a tool the world can actually use. This discovery proves something big: in the next 20 years, quantum computers will be used to tackle some of the hardest problems in the world. And it won’t just be about solving complicated math puzzles. Quantum computers will help run energy systems, analyze massive amounts of data, power businesses, and a whole lot more. We’re standing at the edge of what people are already calling the “quantum age.” With that in mind, there’s still a lot of work that needs to be done — we’re still in the early innings of the quantum build-out. Right now, the technology lives mostly inside research labs and the biggest tech firms. It’s powerful, but still years away from being part of everyday life. But make no mistake, the opportunity is very real. This is a pivotal stage of development, much like the early days of classical computing or the internet and we’re already starting to see that potential realized in the markets. The Call That Lit the Fuse On December 27, 2024, I made a bold prediction: Quantum is going to overtake AI in the lexicon of investing this year. At the time, it sounded almost crazy. AI had dominated headlines for years. ChatGPT, Nvidia, every tech CEO on earth couldn’t stop talking about it. But when I looked at the charts, the research, and the way money was starting to move, I could see something changing. The tide was shifting in the direction of quantum computing. Even better, I gave you five specific names that were at the top of my watchlist.Here’s what happened next: - IBM (IBM): Called at $227 — climbed over 28% - IonQ (IONQ): Called at $37 — is just 5% away from a double - D-Wave (QBTS): Called at $6.50 — shares tripled in less than a year - Rigetti (RGTI): Called at $9 — is a four-bagger - Quantum Computing (QUBT): Called at $12 — it’s more than doubled While the S&P has crawled into double-digits by 14%, this little “quantum basket” has averaged a jaw-dropping 147%. If you acted on that call, you didn’t just beat the market — you smoked it. Now here’s where experience kicks in. When most folks see numbers like that, the natural instinct is to get greedy, to believe the ride never ends. But markets don’t work that way. They move in rhythms — they surge, they breathe, they surge again. And the best traders know that the moment to celebrate is also the moment to step back and protect what you’ve made. When we started watching these names, most were billion-dollar minnows. Now some are racing toward $10 billion valuations without turning a profit. That’s a red flag. That’s when discipline separates the pros from the Joes. Filtering the Quantum Noise These moves are undeniably incredible, but let’s confuse a price breakout with a technology breakthrough. The science of quantum is still years away from everyday use. What’s driving these parabolic charts right now is excitement, not revenue. And excitement alone never lasts forever. Wall Street is always looking ahead — the big money isn’t just focused on what’s working today — it trades on what they believe might work tomorrow. And right now, the story of quantum has captured imaginations. The leading experts in the science are calling this the NISQ-era of quantum — Noisy, Intermediate-Scale Quantum. That means we can build small machines that run simple programs, but they’re noisy, fragile, and limited. They can’t yet deliver real-world breakthroughs. It’s exciting science, but it’s not ready for commercial production As a result, only the biggest players with the most resources are likely to remain the most powerful quantum developers. It’s a lot like dot-com stocks in 1999. Yes, Amazon changed the world. But Pets.com? Gone. If history serves us, quantum will follow a similar pattern. Players like IBM and Microsoft will very likely be the first to market with their own mass-market quantum solutions. But it’s an open question for everyone else. I can’t tell you how many emails I’ve gotten from traders saying, “Jonathan, I saw your quantum list in January but thought I’d missed the move.” You haven’t missed out on quantum’s biggest gains. The sector isn’t going anywhere. What matters the most right now is listening to the experts you trust, having the patience to wait for better entries and the discipline to focus on companies that are more than just hype. The “Qombie” Test Right now, every time a company puts out a press release, every time someone talks about a benchmark win, the stocks catch fire. But the longer we head down this road, the more we’ll see a lot of these stories just don’t hold up to scrutiny. Scott Aaronson is one of the leading quantum theorists in the world. He has a great term for this, he calls them quantum zombies or “qombies” for short. They look alive when you first see the headline, but they’re really just noise, cherry-picked data, or marketing spin. Put them through tougher tests and they fall apart. Aaronson is a longtime professor at the University of Texas at Austin and now heads up quantum research at OpenAI. Before you let another quantum headline move your portfolio, ask: - Is this company actually making their machines more dependable, or are they just bragging about how much new and extra stuff they’ve added? - Do their results hold up when the “noise” is taken away, or do they fall apart under tougher testing? - Has another lab independently replicated the result? - Are they showing that their machine really beats the best regular supercomputers — or only claiming a win in some special case? - Are they using standardized metrics — or house-invented scores? If any answer is “no,” odds are good you’re looking at a qombie. And in September 2025, several of the wins we talked about don’t cut it. IONQ is the closest to meeting parts of the test. They’ve published roadmaps about error correction and fidelity, and they’ve put forward metrics (like “algorithmic qubits”) that try to translate science into something useful. But even they haven’t cleared the bar of fully replicated, fault-tolerant wins. Rigetti and D-Wave talk a big game about connectivity, scaling, and system access. But when you strip it down, most of their “breakthroughs” don’t survive independent replication or outperform the best classical systems on open benchmarks. By Aaronson’s criteria, they’re still in the qombie camp. Quantum Computing Inc. is even further back. They don’t show credible progress on error correction, standardized metrics, or replicated wins. Right now, they’re a stock market story, not a science story. Where the Money Still Belongs My favorites are reliable names with a proven track record. And they’ve never changed even as I highlighted those other stocks in January: - IBM (IBM): The company that invented the personal computer and still holds more U.S. patents than any other corporation. Now leading the charge in logical qubits and quantum error correction. +26% since January. - Microsoft (MSFT): The firm that turned cloud into a trillion-dollar business — now betting on quantum as the next frontier. - Alphabet (GOOGL): The same lab that claimed “quantum supremacy” in 2019 — still pouring billions into the race. These probably won’t triple in a quarter. But they also won’t collapse when the NISQ bubble pops. Here’s the breakdown for any trader looking for exposure to the well-backed incumbents (long-term) as well as the flash-in-the-pan names (short-term): - Fade / underweight: IONQ, QBTS, RGTI, QUBT — spectacular runs, but narrative risk is sky-high. Great trades, dangerous investments. - Prefer / overweight: IBM, GOOGL, MSFT — credible research, diversified businesses, quantum optionality without hype-driven downside. No FOMO, Just Process The quantum call was a home run. But here’s the part most people miss: it wasn’t luck, and it wasn’t magic. It was discipline. We sized the trades right, we locked in profits when the market gave them to us, and we treated every headline like noise until the tape confirmed the story. That’s how pros do it. If you caught those moves, you know what I’m talking about. If you missed them, don’t sweat it. Around here, we don’t do FOMO. What we do is build a process that lets us step into trades with confidence, protect our downside, and ride the big stories without blowing up our account.

One of these players is Stanley Druckenmiller, head of the Duquesne Family Office. The billionaire has invested in -- and continues to invest in -- a variety of major players in this high-potential field. Why is everyone, from billionaires to the smallest retail investor, so excited about AI? The technology promises to be a gamechanger, following others like the Internet or smartphones. These sorts of technologies have what it takes to generate billions of dollars for the companies involved in them -- and for investors. In the case of AI, analysts predict today's billion-dollar market may even reach beyond $2 trillion in the early part of the next decade. This potential hasn't escaped Druckenmiller's attention. He invested in two of today's most successful AI companies -- Nvidia and Palantir Technologies -- earlier in this AI story, then sold all of those shares in recent quarters. And in the latest quarter, the billionaire dropped yet another AI giant. But don't worry: Druckenmiller still is bullish on AI, and he even opened a new position in a key AI player. Let's find out more. A brilliant 30-year track record First, a quick note about Druckenmiller. This billionaire founded Duquesne Capital Management and ran the fund for 30 years prior to opening his family office. His track record? He posted a 30% average annual return, and he did this without any money-losing years. So, Druckenmiller has clearly proven himself, meaning when he makes a move, investors take notice. About a year ago, the billionaire shocked investors when he closed out his position in AI chip giant Nvidia, and earlier this year, he sold all of his shares in Palantir. These stocks have soared more than 1,000% and 2,000%, respectively, over the past three years, and the companies continue to report strong revenue growth and customer demand. We don't know the exact reason for Druckenmiller's moves, though it may be fair to say it has to do with these stocks' valuations. Druckenmiller mentioned in a Bloomberg interview shortly after selling Nvidia that the valuation ""was rich."" And some analysts have said that Palantir, trading for 278x forward earnings estimates, has become overvalued. Druckenmiller's selling spree But Druckenmiller's AI selling spree wasn't over. In the second quarter of this year, he made one more major move: He closed out his position in Amazon (AMZN -0.61%), an e-commerce giant and an AI leader through its cloud computing unit Amazon Web Services (AWS). As the world's biggest cloud provider, AWS offers a variety of AI products and services to customers, and this has resulted in a $123 billion annual revenue run rate for the unit. Still, Druckenmiller shifted out of this bet and into another AI giant in the second quarter. He opened a position in Microsoft (MSFT 0.50%), adding 200,930 shares. This isn't a massive position, as it represents about 2.5% of the portfolio, but it gives the billionaire exposure to a key player that may offer him yet another AI win. Software powerhouse Microsoft has gone all in on AI, and this technology has been driving growth in recent quarters. In the latest fiscal year, the company's cloud business, Azure, topped $75 billion in revenue, representing an increase of 34%, amid AI demand. Microsoft is growing data centers more quickly than rivals and now has more than any other: about 400 over 70 regions. A key partner of OpenAI The company, having invested almost $14 billion, is a key partner of OpenAI, the AI research lab that created chatbot ChapGPT and is positioned to drive AI development. Meanwhile, the stock trades for 33x forward earnings estimates, offering it plenty of room to run as the demand for AI potentially lifts revenue in the quarters ahead. So, should you follow Druckenmiller's moves? All of the AI stocks I've mentioned here represent smart long-term buys, and decisions to sell may not represent a vote against the particular player -- but rather a move to lock in a profit after holding on for a certain period of time, especially on a stock that's gained in valuation, or the desire to shift into another potential winner. This means you don't have to copy Druckenmiller's -- or any other investor's -- exact moves. But a purchase of Microsoft right now is a smart bet -- for Druckemiller and the rest of us -- considering this company's market leadership, investments in AI, recent revenue growth, and the idea that this AI boom has a lot farther to go."

Keith Weiss, alongside a respected crew of analysts, said that worries about Microsoft's association with OpenAI, the speed of Azure's expansion, and the longevity of its productivity suite have hurt sentiment. Still, the data shows the fears are unfounded. Weiss lifted his price target to $625 from $582 and reiterated an Overweight rating, arguing that Microsoft’s mix of double-digit growth, disciplined spending, and shareholder returns offers a high-teens total return profile that remains underpriced. “Confidence in a path to shedding those weights and a broadening set of growth drivers elevates MSFT to Top Pick,” Weiss wrote in the note. He thinks that OpenAI's $300 billion cloud deal with Oracle (ORCL) is less of a blow to Microsoft than if the company were not smartly directing its limited GPU and data center resources toward higher-value business customers. At the same time, patterns in capital expenditures indicate that Azure AI revenue might be higher than expected, and poll results show that Microsoft's productivity tools are still quite popular. Weiss says that what appears like a possible vulnerability is a sign of strength, and that belief might spread across the tech trade. The AI and cloud debate The OpenAI concern has hurt Microsoft's stock story in the last several months. Investors were apprehensive that the ChatGPT maker's search for partnerships with other companies, including its $300 billion deal with Oracle, may slow down Azure's growth. Morgan Stanley does not believe Microsoft's pursuit will, in any shape or form, diminish the growth trajectory of Azure or its broader competitive position in AI-driven cloud services. Weiss called the Oracle deal a ""incrementally positive data point,"" saying that Microsoft is handling limited GPU capacity and ""Powered Data Center Shells"" in a manner that puts business customers first. That might imply more stable and successful AI income sources instead of being too reliant on one well-known partner. The company also pointed to Microsoft's capital investment as a sign of Azure's AI potential. Weiss concluded that Azure AI income might be higher than current predictions by calculating capital expenditures committed to AI projects. That means the cloud unit isn't slowing down; it's just expanding the number of places it can grow. Microsoft's productivity tools are built on top of this and are still an important part of how businesses function. The analyst report cites survey data that shows ""durable"" mindshare and market share, indicating that traditional firms are still quietly compounding as newer AI drivers gain traction. Morgan Stanley's bullish prediction is based not just on growth drivers, but also on the statistics behind Microsoft's returns. Weiss stated that the combination of double-digit sales growth, operational cost control, and consistent shareholder distributions results in a total return profile that the market has not fully priced in. The revised $625 target, up from $582, indicates significant upside from present levels. When Weiss considers Microsoft's capital allocation plan, which includes a combination of share repurchases and an increasing dividend payout, he sees a road to a ""durable high-teens"" annualized return. That projection contrasts with the market's continuous discounting of the stock owing to expected risks connected with AI performance and competitive dynamics, and the hoopla surrounding names such as Nvidia and Oracle. Morgan Stanley believes these risks are mitigated by Microsoft's ability to increase productivity from its expenditures, allocate capital effectively, and sustain dominance in key businesses. The takeaway: Investors may be undervaluing Microsoft's position in AI development, as well as its capacity to compound shareholder value via discipline and size. In this regard, the upgrading is as much about balance-sheet strength as it is about technical advancement. Ripples beyond Microsoft: What the tech field might learn Morgan Stanley's decision doesn't simply change how we think about Microsoft; it also hints at a thesis for the tech world as a whole. If a giant like MSFT can pull off this mix of fundamental strength and AI-era optionality, other companies could quietly do the same. For example, cloud peers and AI infrastructure players. Oracle's $300 billion deal with OpenAI might have threatened Microsoft's supremacy. On the other hand, Weiss says it should be seen as a sign that AI partners are becoming more diverse and that limited resources push businesses to make smart choices about where to spend their money. In that sense, Microsoft's chosen restraint might become a playbook. If investors start to rethink how they understand risk and optionality, the rest of the software group may see their ratings change or their stocks move about. Microsoft's update might be less of a one-time event and more of a big change that changes investors' expectations about how long things will take, how many options they have, and how they can use AI strategically. There is also a feeling side to it. Microsoft's value is still lower than that of many other big software companies, meaning that if Weiss's theory is correct, multiples might increase. That gap makes it easy to compare, particularly across companies that work with cloud, data, or platforms. If markets accept this framing, multiples may compress downward among overly hyped names and stretch upward for those whose optionality is undervalued. To sum up, this call is more than just a bet that Microsoft will do well. It's a hint, if not a warning, for tech traders to rethink their discretionary AI risk, concentrate on capital discipline, and balance underlying cushion against growth promises."

The company's stock fell 5% in premarket trading before quickly rebounding to gain more than 1% in the first hour after the opening bell Thursday morning. The deal brings the value of the companies' joint agreements to $22.4 billion. Livingston, N.J.-based CoreWeave provides cloud computing infrastructure specifically designed for tasks requiring massive amounts of GPU processing power, like training machine learning and AI models. This deal promises OpenAI additional computing power needed to train and operate its AI models on top of what CoreWeave already provides the AI giant. The two companies signed an initial agreement for computing power last March for $11.9 billion, then added a $4 billion agreement in May. “We are proud to expand our relationship with OpenAI, a company consistently at the forefront of advancing artificial intelligence,” CoreWeave co-founder, chair, and CEO Michael Intrator said. The news comes after OpenAI announced on Tuesday that its Stargate AI data center and cloud computing site in Abilene, Texas, will open three new sites with partner company Oracle (ORCL) in a deal worth $300 billion. The AI giant said Stargate aims to secure 10 gigawatts of capacity for the site, worth $500 billion, by the end of the year. Nvidia (NVDA), which has signed multibillion-dollar computing purchase agreements with CoreWeave, just minted a new deal with OpenAI in which OpenAI will build at least 10 gigawatts of AI data centers with Nvidia, and Nvidia will invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI. CoreWeave shares, meanwhile, are up 230% since its IPO in March. The company has been aggressive in dealmaking, inking agreements with OpenAI, Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), and IBM (IBM). Wall Street analysts have largely been bullish on the company. But skeptics see potential issues, especially in the CoreWeave's concentration of customers. ""Chances were already high that CoreWeave would be involved in the NVDA/OAI collaboration, given their experience as an infrastructure partner to both OpenAI and NVDA, who are also CRWV's core clients,"" Hedgeye Risk Management wrote in a research note published Thursday morning after the deal announcement. ""Enormous customer concentration is coming, as we think NVDA and OAI will be CRWV's only core customers by the end of 2027."" CoreWeave's most recent earnings report showed that Microsoft accounted for 70% of the company's revenue for the quarter."

That’s the value of the entire annual economic output of a handful of countries such as Kenya, Ukraine, Belarus, and Indonesia. It’s also what Nvidia just pledged to invest in OpenAI to build AI datacenters. Yesterday, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called it “the biggest AI infrastructure project in history.” Let’s go to our technology expert Luke Lango for more context. From Luke’s Daily Notes in Innovation Investor: Nvidia supplies the chips and capital, while OpenAI builds and trains the models. It’s effectively a “Manhattan Project for AI.” For context, $100 billion makes this the largest AI deal ever announced. Ten gigawatts of compute would exceed the combined AI capacity of Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google. This is exponential. The logic is simple: Nvidia has the best hardware; OpenAI has the best software. Together, they anchor America’s AI dominance. The winners extend beyond them: $100 billion will flow into chips, cooling, networking, switches, and power — lifting the entire AI supply chain. So, this is hugely bullish for AI, right? Yes…and no. I’m on a Slack Channel with a handful of InvestorPlace’s leading analysts and market researchers I want to share with you the conversation that took place yesterday in the wake of this headline. I’ll leave out the names since none of these individuals realized I would be featuring their unedited thoughts today. Analyst 1: This is huge news for NVDA. Analyst 2: As the internet bubble peaked, companies started announcing big deals with each other. No cash changed hands, it was usually ad swaps. But each booked the ads as revenue and made their financials look better before adjustments. Is this similar? NVDA may not give OpenAI $100 billion in cash. That could be the MSRP of what they deliver. This isn’t bad news but is the market starting to get frothy? Seeing other big deals where the cash is less than the headline could be a sign to watch for. Analyst 3: I had the same read. There are just constant money schemes every week… Feels like 2021, but instead of people buying JPEGs, it’s public and private institutions opening the floodgates… Analyst 2: Feels like 1998, with companies working together to announce big numbers that individual investors believe are true. NVDA has a 50%+ net margin, 70% gross margin. If this is $100b in chips, it costs them $0.30 on the dollar. If it’s help with construction, they spend $1 in support to get orders for more than $1. It’s like a retailer paying slotting fees at grocery stores. Yes, the Nvidia/OpenAI news is bullish. But it also may signal where we are in this cycle – perhaps the first clear glimpse of the ultimate market top, finally visible like a snowy mountain peak emerging from the clouds. Luke spoke to this in yesterday’s Daily Notes: Bubble signs are emerging… But bubbles can run long. The trick isn’t spotting the bubble, it’s spotting the pop. Right now, we see bubble signals, not pop signals. We believe this AI surge still has at least 12 months of explosive runway. That’s 12 months of opportunity, momentum, and gains across red-hot AI stocks. Stay long. Stay bullish. Stay ready. If we’re in the final melt-up, blow-off top, then where should we be looking for the biggest gains? Surprising no one, AI. Of course, this gives us a wide opportunity set. Let’s narrow down for one illustration… What do you get when you combine AI, rising geopolitical tension, and cutting-edge robotics? Military drones, massive sector growth, and enormous investment gains. As to that sector growth, according to The Business Research Company, the global market for defense drones was roughly $16 billion in 2024 and is projected to grow toward $23 billion by 2029. Some AI-focused forecasts put it closer to $50 billion by 2032 as autonomous capabilities expand. Leading drone stocks are already exploding in anticipation. Take Kratos Defense & Security Solutions (KTOS). Luke recommended KTOS to his Breakout Trader subscribers in May of 2023. As I write Tuesday morning, they’re up 435%. But even after this explosive run-up, the KTOS trade could have plenty of juice thanks to an unusual phenomenon playing out in today’s market… Back to Luke: Something exceptionally rare is happening in D.C.; something that has only happened a few times before in our nation’s history… The U.S. government is buying equity stakes – in America’s AI supply chain… This is not business as usual. It’s industrial policy by way of Wall Street. And it could create massive upside opportunities for investors able to identify who’s next… After explaining more about what’s happening, Luke highlights the tie-in to KTOS. But it isn’t the only defense contractor that Luke believes the government might be eyeing: The DoD’s Replicator initiative aims to field “thousands” of autonomous systems. Kratos (KTOS) is front-running with its Valkyrie combat drone. AeroVironment (AVAV) is delivering miniature munition Switchblades at scale. Either could see structured deals to accelerate production. Now, while military drones represent one striking application of intelligent machines, they’re just the tip of a much larger robotics revolution unfolding across a variety of industries. And if we’ve now begun the final melt-up, you want exposure to this corner of the market as it’s likely to bring some of the biggest moves. On that note, Luke – along with Louis Navellier and Eric Fry – have gone on record, making a huge prediction… The next trillion-dollar winner will be in Physical AI: the fusion of robotics and artificial intelligence. Here are their respective quick takes: From Louis: We’re at the beginning of an innovation revolution built on robotics, AI-powered factories, autonomous logistics and more. It’s arguably the most transformational thing to happen to our society since the Industrial Revolution. From Eric: Thanks to AI, robots are now stepping off the screen and into the real world – and taking over physical tasks once reserved for humans. This shift will reshape entire industries… It’s blindingly obvious that the world of the future will look little like the world today. From Luke: We’re in the middle of the most profound platform shift in human economic history. All the growth in today’s economy is happening inside the AI ecosystem. Everything else is just noise. Given the enormous opportunity in physical AI/robotics stocks, Luke, Louis, and Eric created a collaborative investment research package highlighting how investors should position their portfolios today. This Day Zero Portfolio holds the seven stocks they’ve identified as best-of-breed in AI-powered robotics. It provides targeted exposure to the next wave of AI exponential progress. I want to cover more ground in today’s Digest, but you can learn more about the portfolio right here. I’ve seen the holdings and there’s a lot of firepower. Here’s the collective bottom line of our experts: If Physical AI follows the same trajectory as cars (self-driving vehicles), PCs (AI PCs), and smartphones (personal assistants) – and we believe it will – we could be looking at $20 trillion or more in value creation. This isn’t just another boom. It’s a multiplier. That’s why we want to encourage you to consider our latest seven picks in robotics, if you haven’t yet. Finally, here’s one more reason to remain in today’s market despite the signs of froth Small caps have finally joined the party. And if history is right, that’s a ringing endorsement of additional gains to come. Back to Luke: Small caps are hot – and that is bullish. The Russell 2000 just hit a record close for the first time since 2021. Here are all 11 historical precedents going back to 1980 for what happens to the S&P 500 in the year after the Russell 2000 hits a record close for the first time in over a year. As you can see, the S&P 500 is higher a year later 10/11 times, with an overall average return of 13% and an average return in up years of 15%. History says that this small-cap breakout is rarely a fluke. When they finally wake up after a long slumber, it usually signals that market breadth is expanding, and risk appetite is broadening. Translation – more gas in the tank for this bull. So, this small-cap price action isn’t just a technical milestone within this bull, it’s a green light for the overall market – for now. Be wise about how you invest… expect heightened volatility along the way… and remember what history suggests directly follows the boom… But if history rhymes, the next leg higher may have just begun. We’ll give Luke today’s send-off: We’re seeing bubble-like behavior, sure — but no signs of a pop yet. And until those pop signals appear, the boom rolls on. The Nvidia + OpenAI “Manhattan Project for AI” is the biggest deal in the industry’s history and proof that this AI Boom is only accelerating. The money, the momentum, and the opportunity are all still in front of us. That’s why we’re staying locked, loaded, and bullish on AI stocks. Have a good evening, Jeff Remsburg"
dd52fb24287db901859ba61e0c61ad8e54262708bf79a30a76d292bef52dc051,MSFT,4 Top Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy in 2025,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/4-top-quantum-computing-stocks-to-buy-in-2025/,www.fool.com,20250920T141500Z,semi,0.65,"Quantum computing is slated to become the next big tech investment trend following artificial intelligence (AI). We're still in the early innings of this exciting technology, but most companies agree that 2030 will be a turning point in this space. However, waiting until 2030 to start investing in this field after the winners are established is a mistake. Many of these companies will likely have dramatically increased in value by then, causing investors to lose out on massive returns. By investing today, it's possible to pick some of the winners in this space before they've become too large to provide substantial returns. I've identified four options that appear to be excellent investments in quantum computing, ranging from startups to established big tech players. By staying balanced in this opportunity, investors can capitalize on the trend while ensuring positive returns. Pure plays: IonQ and D-Wave Quantum The stocks that most investors consider in reference to the quantum computing arms race are pure-play investments, such as IonQ (IONQ -3.92%) and D-Wave Quantum (QBTS -5.51%). These companies are startups that have no other goal besides developing commercially viable quantum computing technologies, and their upside could be immense if they achieve their goals. IonQ and D-Wave only have market caps of $16.5 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively. This makes them relatively small companies in general, although they could grow to be monsters if their technology becomes widespread. The primary reason I prefer these two over many of the other quantum computing pure plays is their approach to quantum computing. The most popular quantum computing technique is superconducting, which involves cooling a particle to near absolute zero to utilize its quantum mechanics to perform calculations. This is an incredibly cost-intensive process, and may be cost-prohibitive in deploying quantum computing at scale, especially in the early years. IonQ doesn't use this approach; its quantum computing technology is known as trapped ion. This provides several key advantages, namely cost (because it doesn't require cooling a particle to absolute zero, it can be done at room temperature) and accuracy. IonQ holds world records in quantum computing accuracy and with the largest concern surrounding quantum computing being how accurate it is, I think IonQ's technology could be a popular pick. D-Wave isn't taking the same approach as many companies. Instead of creating a general-purpose quantum computer, it's developing a quantum annealing platform. This approach cannot be applied to every quantum computing application, but it excels at optimization problems, which can be solved by finding the lowest energy state in a system. D-Wave's technology will be useful in determining logistics networks and statistical models, which represent a large chunk of quantum computing use cases. D-Wave doesn't have to capture the entire market; it just needs to secure enough business to make it viable. Both of these two stocks are high-risk, high-reward investments, and balancing them out with more established players is a smart idea. Legacy tech companies: Microsoft and Alphabet Both Microsoft (MSFT 0.50%) and Alphabet (GOOG 0.86%) (GOOGL 0.82%) are developing quantum computing technologies in-house for their cloud computing divisions. Currently, Alphabet and Microsoft are paying a substantial premium to their current primary computing hardware supplier, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). If they can develop a viable quantum computing option for these platforms in-house and not have to purchase them from a third party like IonQ or D-Wave, they will save a ton of money and become more profitable. This makes quantum computing a highly lucrative field to invest in, and both companies have already announced significant breakthroughs in the realm of quantum computing. Furthermore, these two companies have nearly unlimited resources to deploy compared to IonQ and D-Wave, and it may become too cost-intensive for them to compete against Microsoft and Alphabet in the long run. However, David versus Goliath stories exist for a reason, and IonQ and D-Wave may ultimately prevail against their larger competitors, but there's no way to know that right now. By purchasing all four of these stocks, investors are taking a balanced approach to the quantum computing investment trend. This gives them the upside of pure plays like IonQ and D-Wave, while also investing in established players like Microsoft and Alphabet, which continue to benefit from the ongoing AI arms race. I believe this cohort has a great chance to outperform the market, and if IonQ or D-Wave achieves significant success, this group could crush the broader market."

""I think I'd be OK either way,"" Okta (OKTA) CEO Todd McKinnon said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. ""I do like the opportunity to talk to investors every quarter about the business and the future and the vision of what we're trying to do."" Still, he added, ""I do think sometimes the industry gets too obsessed with the quarterly numbers ... from a single quarter."" For McKinnon, a good balance would involve reporting a little less frequently ""but having long-term strategic conversations with investors."" Okta posted Q2 earnings that beat on its top and bottom lines, fueled in part by global organizations and government agencies. Revenue hit $728 million, topping consensus estimates of $711 million, according to Bloomberg data. Earnings per share came in $0.91, versus $0.84 expected. The company raised its full-year revenue outlook to between $2.875 billion and $2.885 billion, a 10% to 11% year-over-year increase. However, its Q3 forecast was more cautious: $728 million to $730 million in revenue, or 9% to 10% growth. Its shares are up 14% year to date, compared to the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 13% advance. Trump's call for eliminating quarterly numbers comes at an awkward time for a company like Okta. It's still carving out market share against giants like Microsoft (MSFT) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW), which means quarterly execution is exactly what investors want to scrutinize. With the stock trading around $90, well below its pandemic-era high of over $290, patience for long-term promises may be limited. Analysts are mixed on how much slack investors should cut. JPMorgan's Brian Essex struck an optimistic tone. In a research note after meeting with Okta executives, he highlighted record pipeline levels, strong public sector wins, and a push to consolidate the fragmented identity market. Essex reiterated an Overweight rating and $92.77 price target, but cautioned that closing those deals and translating them into sustained growth remains key. Evercore ISI analyst Peter Levine called Okta's quarter ""well executed"" and flagged its $100 million acquisition of Axiom Security as a potential differentiator in the fledgling AI security market. He argued the deal bolsters Okta's private access management capabilities, which could become a ""key identity layer"" as companies rush to deploy AI agents. His firm issued an Outperform rating with a $130 target price."

(NASDAQ:AVGO) has expanded its long-running partnership with Lloyds Banking Group through a multi-year agreement aimed at accelerating the bank's digital transformation strategy. Under the deal, Lloyds will broaden its adoption of Broadcom's infrastructure software, including VMware Cloud Foundation and mainframe solutions, to reinforce the resilience, agility, and scalability of its technology systems. The initiative is designed to deliver faster, more reliable digital services to Lloyds' 28 million U.K. customers while supporting the bank's modernization push. Also Read: Broadcom Ties CEO Fortune To Explosive AI Revenue Targets Broadcom will play a central role in consolidating Lloyds' data centers and creating a consistent private cloud operating model. The framework combines the flexibility of public cloud with the performance, security, and cost benefits of on-premises infrastructure. It will support workloads ranging from traditional and modern applications to those driven by artificial intelligence, while ensuring unified governance and controls. The announcement comes as Broadcom continues to benefit from rising demand across the AI ecosystem. Tech majors such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are accelerating AI investments, fueling appetite for Broadcom's Custom Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). Analysts highlight that the company's position in ASICs is increasingly competitive with Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominance in graphics processing units, particularly among hyperscalers and vertical AI markets. Macquarie analyst Arthur Lai recently initiated coverage with an Outperform rating and a $420 price forecast, pointing to Broadcom's growing ASIC market share. The stock has surged more than 55% year-to-date, significantly outperforming the Nasdaq 100's 16% gain. The rally has been supported by stronger-than-expected third-quarter results, which included $15.95 billion in revenue and a 63% increase in AI-related sales. Momentum has been further reinforced by Broadcom's confirmation of a $10 billion AI chip order from OpenAI, underscoring its ability to capture large-scale contracts in the rapidly expanding sector.

fb6d6a0c57f64ea1f945b509173dbd5e4609fd76e4f734bf65347d50c96cb14d,MSFT,3 Dividend - Paying ETFs to Buy in September Even If the S & P 500 Sells Off,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/16/3-dividend-paying-etfs-buy-september/?source=iedfolrf0000001,www.fool.com,20250916T093000Z,semi,0.65,"We aren't even through September, and the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.53%) has already produced an 11.2% year-to-date total return (dividends included) at the time of this writing. That puts the index on track for its third consecutive year of higher-than-historical gains. Over the long term, the S&P 500 has averaged a 9% to 10% annualized total return. Outsized gains have made the S&P 500 relatively expensive, putting pressure on companies to deliver on lofty expectations. Companies that sustain high earnings growth can certainly grow into their valuations over time. But at times like this, it's especially important to make sure you are investing in high-conviction companies with solid fundamentals rather than ones that are full of hot air that's waiting to compress at the slightest hint of trouble. Another approach is to invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that offer exposure to dozens, if not hundreds or even thousands of stocks. Many ETFs also offer dividends from the stocks they hold, which is an easy way to collect passive income. Here's why these Fool.com contributors believe that the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG 0.27%), iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (DGRO 0.55%), and the Global X S&P 500 Covered Call ETF (XYLD 0.81%) stand out as top ETFs to buy even if the S&P 500 sells off. 1. A low-cost ETF for growth investors seeking passive income Daniel Foelber (Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF): The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF is a long-term investment tool first and a passive income source second. Unlike funds that invest in low-growth companies with high yields, the Dividend-Appreciation ETF targets some of the top growth and value stocks around. The objective is to focus on companies that can grow their earnings and their dividends over time rather than companies that fetch high yields right now. That's why you'll find over 16% of the fund invested in ""Ten Titans"" growth stocks like Microsoft (MSFT 0.50%), Apple, Broadcom (AVGO -1.24%), and Oracle, but not other well-known mega-cap growth stocks like Amazon (AMZN -0.61%) or Tesla that don't pay dividends. Or why JPMorgan Chase is a top holding in the fund but not Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.77%) (BRK.B 0.78%). Berkshire is the largest financial stock by market cap, but it doesn't pay a dividend because Warren Buffett has long believed that Berkshire can produce a higher total return over time by reinvesting profits rather than distributing them. A company that pays dividends and regularly repurchases stock is inherently more balanced than a company like Amazon that pours profits back into its business and even dilutes its shareholders over time. Microsoft could grow much faster if it mirrored Amazon's approach. Instead, it generates a ton of free cash flow and makes calculated bets that could pay off in the long run while also rewarding its shareholders by more than offsetting its stock-based compensation with buybacks. Similarly, a key difference between Broadcom and Nvidia is that Broadcom steadily grows its dividend, with 15 consecutive years of dividend raises (often double-digit annual percentage increases). Broadcom is rapidly expanding its artificial intelligence (AI) revenue stream as demand for its custom XPU chips for data centers. But instead of betting the farm on this demand, Broadcom is staying disciplined by remaining committed to its dividend. Microsoft and Broadcom have low yields because their stock prices have outpaced their dividend growth rates, not due to a lack of commitment to dividend raises. Many yield-focused ETFs would exclude these companies, but the Dividend Appreciation ETF is unique in that it doesn't punish a company for having a low yield just because its stock has outperformed. In this vein, the Dividend Appreciation ETF is ideally suited for investors who value dividend quality over quantity. The fund also sports a mere 0.05% expense ratio, which is just $5 for every $10,000 invested. The Dividend Appreciation ETF would likely fall in line with the S&P 500, as it has high exposure to many of the top S&P 500 stocks. But its focus on quality is precisely why it's the kind of fund that investors can be confident buying and holding even during times of uncertainty. 2. iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF is a great choice for ramping up your passive income Scott Levine (iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF): If the prospect of the S&P 500 plunging lower in the coming weeks is keeping you from sleeping soundly, you're not alone. It's on many investors' minds right now. As undesirable as a market downturn may be, though, the move to procuring more passive income through the iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF with its 2.1% dividend yield is a great way to help fortify your holdings -- and drift off to dreamland after you count your sheep. With 397 holdings, the iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF is chock-full of dividend stocks that are committed to raising their payouts and that represent various sectors. While financials make up the lion's share of the fund (about 20%), information technology stocks and healthcare stocks also figure prominently in the fund with weightings of 18.6% and 16.9%, respectively. For investors interested in securing their portfolios, the fund's diversification with respect to different sectors is highly desirable as it mitigates the risk of a downturn in a particular industry. The fund includes a who's who of industry leaders. Semiconductor stalwart Broadcom is the iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF is the largest holding, while tech peer Apple is the second-largest position. With the massive amounts of free cash flow that Broadcom and Apple are generating right now due to growth in AI, both companies have room to comfortably hike their payouts higher. The fund also includes companies that have long track records of increasingly rewarding shareholders. Johnson & Johnson, the third-largest holding, as well as Procter & Gamble, the ninth-largest holding, are both Dividend Kings -- which are companies that have paid and raised their dividends for at least 50 years. With a super low 0.08% expense ratio, investors have a low-cost opportunity to ramp up their passive income with a reliable dividend growth-focused ETF that's worthy of loading up on right now. 3. An ETF offering a current distribution yield of 13.5% Lee Samaha (Global X S&P 500 Covered Call ETF): Investors worried about a market sell-off, and who also have generating monthly income in mind, might want to take a look at some of the many ETFs available that offer access to a covered call strategy. It's not an easy strategy for retail investors to replicate, and it can offer some security and income when markets are declining. The Global X S&P 500 Covered Call ETF employs a strategy of buying the S&P 500 index and writing call options on it. Buying the index gives upside exposure to equities. The covered call strategy needs a bit more explaining. A call option on an index gives the buyer the right to buy the index at a specified price (the strike price) within a specified time frame. It's typically purchased by bullish investors who hope to buy the index at a price lower than its future value. Buyers pay a premium for the option. As such, a seller, or ""writer,"" of a call option (as the ETF effectively is in this case) will pick up a premium and is hoping the index won't rise above the strike price so the option isn't taken up. By following the buy equities/sell call options strategy, the ETF is likely to underperform when markets are surging (as call option buyers will exercise their options), but outperform in flat or slightly up/down markets (call options won't be taken up) or in down markets for the same reason. It's unlikely that the ETF will generate positive total returns in a downtrending market (the equities will decline). Still, it can do so in moderately up/down markets. In both cases, it offers a monthly income (with a trailing 12-month distribution yield of 13.5%), making it a good option for investors seeking a monthly income."

Here the Best of the Bunch . ,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/15/nvidia-invest-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks/,www.fool.com,20250915T101500Z,semi,0.65,"Many investors like to keep track of famous investors' portfolios. That's why you'll see lots of articles about the stocks that Warren Buffett, Bill Ackman, David Tepper, and other billionaires are buying. Sometimes the trades made by well-known, successful investors can provide great ideas for other investors. But there's another approach that isn't as popular, but maybe it should be: Monitoring what's in the portfolios of large, successful companies. Take Nvidia (NVDA 0.86%), for example. The giant chipmaker has $4.3 billion invested in six artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. And one stands out as the best of the bunch. Nvidia's AI six-pack As of June 30, 2025, Nvidia owned more than 7.7 million shares of Applied Digital (APLD -6.71%) worth $77.7 million. Applied Digital operates blockchain and high-performance computing data centers. The company is also in the process of selling its cloud services business. Nvidia's 1.1 million shares of Arm Holdings (ARM -3.11%) were valued at $178.1 million at the end of the second quarter of 2025. Arm is a leading developer of semiconductors, especially CPUs. Over 325 billion chips made by the company have been shipped during its more than three decades in business. CoreWeave (CRWV -3.44%) ranks as Nvidia's largest investment, with its nearly 24.3 million shares worth roughly $3.96 billion at the end of Q2. AI is the center of CoreWeave's business. Its cloud platform was built from the ground up to support generative AI applications. Like CoreWeave, Nebius Group (NBIS -7.63%) provides a full-stack cloud platform focused on AI. Nvidia's nearly 1.2 million shares of Nebius were valued at $65.9 million as of June 30, 2025. However, that stake is worth a lot more now: Nebius Group's shares recently skyrocketed after landing a multibillion-dollar deal with Microsoft (MSFT 0.50%). Why is drugmaker Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX -7.86%) on a list of AI stocks in Nvidia's portfolio? The company is a pioneer in using AI for drug discovery. Nvidia owned 7.7 million shares of Recursion worth almost $39 million at the end of Q2. Chinese autonomous driving technology company WeRide (WRD -4.08%) is Nvidia's smallest equity investment. The GPU maker's stake in WeRide was valued at around $13.7 million at the end of Q2. WeRide uses Nvidia's technology in its robotaxis, mini-robobuses, and robovans. How these AI stocks compare Half of Nvidia's AI portfolio consists of large-cap stocks. Arm is by far the biggest of the group with a market cap of around $163 billion. CoreWeave's and Nebius Group's market caps are $57 billion and $22 billion, respectively. There's only one small-cap stock in the mix -- Recursion Pharmaceuticals. However, the AI-focused drugmaker's market cap of $1.98 billion is nearly in the mid-cap category, along with WeRide and Applied Digital. Unsurprisingly, Arm boasts the greatest revenue ($4.12 billion over the last 12 months) of these six stocks owned by Nvidia. But CoreWeave's trailing 12-month revenue of $3.53 billion isn't too far behind. The others have much smaller revenue, with WeRide standing at the top of the laggards, with trailing 12-month sales of roughly $410.5 million. Arm is also the most profitable stock in the group, with trailing 12-month earnings of $699 million. All of the others are losing money right now, except for Nebius. We can throw earnings-based valuation metrics out of the window in trying to compare these six stocks. However, there's a clear winner based on price-to-sales ratios: CoreWeave. The AI cloud platform provider's shares trade at 16.2 times trailing-12-month sales. Applied Digital comes in second place with a price-to-sales multiple of 23.7. What about growth prospects? I suspect all of these stocks have room to run. Based on Wall Street earnings growth projections for next year, though, CoreWeave comes out on top again. Analysts think the company's earnings could soar more than 72% in 2026. The best of the bunch What's the best AI stock in Nvidia's portfolio? I think it's CoreWeave. The main knock against CoreWeave is that it isn't profitable yet. However, the reason why that's the case is that the company continues to invest heavily in building out infrastructure to capitalize on its huge growth opportunity. CoreWeave has the most attractive valuation and the strongest growth prospects (according to Wall Street, anyway) of the six AI stocks owned by Nvidia. I agree with analysts' bullish view about the stock. At least for now, CoreWeave looks like the best of the bunch."

Of course, one area where the company continues to deliver is its dividend. Even as the software and cloud giant is spending heavily to build artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, cash generation remains robust, setting the stage for further dividend growth for years to come. Of course, the case for Microsoft's dividend isn't about a high yield. It's about safety, consistent increases, and the company's capacity to keep lifting the payout as earnings expand. In fact, despite its low yield, Microsoft arguably remains one of the best dividend stocks around -- despite its conservative dividend yield. Here are three reasons Microsoft's dividend still stands out. 1. A reliable dividend The best place to start is with dependability. Microsoft earned $13.64 per share in fiscal 2025 (fiscal year ended June 30). Yet, it's only paying out a small fraction of these earnings in dividends. At the dividends $0.83 quarterly run rate ($3.32 annualized), the dividend represents roughly 24% of last year's earnings per share -- a conservative level for a mature, cash-rich company. Moving over to the cash flow statement, it's a similar story. In fiscal 2025, net cash from operations was over $136 billion, and capital expenditures totaled roughly $64.5 billion, leaving free cash flow near $71.6 billion. Yet, even with so much cash flow, Microsoft paid just $24 billion in dividends -- only about one-third of its free cash flow. Such significant headroom gives management flexibility to continue investing in growth while steadily raising the payout. 2. Strong dividend growth potential Microsoft has been paying quarterly dividends for years and has repeatedly lifted the rate. Indeed, it's risen from $0.52 five years ago and $0.31 10 years ago. The current $0.83 per-share quarterly dividend equates to $3.32 per share annually. At recent prices, the yield sits at about 0.7% -- modest but more meaningful when considering the dividend's growth potential. Importantly, further increases are highly probable, given the company's incredible business momentum recently. In its fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, revenue rose 18% year over year, and Microsoft Cloud revenue climbed 27%. The company is bullish on its growth prospects, investing heavily in expansion opportunities. In fact, management expects fiscal first-quarter capital expenditures to top $30 billion, ""driven by the continued strong demand signals we see,"" said Microsoft CFO Amy Hood in the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call. Those demand signals, of course, have been bolstered by the company's ongoing integration of AI features into its software and services. ""Cloud and AI is the driving force of business transformation across every industry,"" Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella said in the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings release. These robust investments should secure strong double-digit annualized revenue and earnings growth for Microsoft for the next few years at least, providing nice support for continued dividend growth. 3. Don't forget Microsoft's buyback program Microsoft's capital expenditures have been mounting as the company builds data centers and capabilities for AI workloads. Even so, the software giant continues to send substantial cash back to shareholders -- and it's doing so in more ways than one. In fiscal 2025, Microsoft repurchased about $18.4 billion of stock and returned $9.4 billion via dividends and buybacks in the fourth quarter alone. A $60 billion repurchase authorization -- approved last fall -- adds another lever that management can pull alongside the dividend. These dynamics point to a thoughtful capital allocation approach: Invest aggressively in the business while returning capital through dividends and buybacks. There are, of course, risks to watch. Heavy capital spending can compress near-term free cash flow, and cloud competition remains intense. But Microsoft's scale, balance sheet strength, and expanding earnings base leave ample room to navigate those pressures while continuing to lift the payout. For investors who prefer safety and growth over headline yield, Microsoft stock is a good option, featuring reliable coverage today, strong growth potential, and a well-rounded capital return program that includes an aggressive share repurchase program."

Investors should also watch critical support levels on Oracle's chart around $261 and $198. Oracle (ORCL) shares soared Wednesday morning after the computing giant raised its outlook for cloud infrastructure sales and said it added several large new customers amid booming AI demand. The company, which has struck deals with big tech customers including Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT), said it now sees cloud infrastructure sales jumping 77% to $18 billion this fiscal year, above its June forecast of 70% growth. CEO Safra Catz told investors that the company expects to sign-up several additional multi-billion-dollar customers in coming months to push its booked cloud orders over half a billion dollars. Leading into the company’s earnings release, Oracle shares had gained 45% so far in 2025, handily outpacing the S&P 500’s return over the same period, boosted by robust demand for its cloud infrastructure services and AI database integration tools. The stock was up 32% at $318 in recent premarket trading. Below, we take a closer look at Oracle’s weekly chart and use technical analysis to identify critical price levels that investors will likely be watching. Flag Pattern Breakout Signals Bullish Continuation After setting their all-time high in late July, Oracle shares consolidated in a flag pattern ahead of the company’s quarterly results, laying the groundwork for a continuation of the longer-term uptrend. Indeed, the stock looks set to gap to a fresh record high on Wednesday. It’s worth noting that the shares have already registered their highest volume this week since mid July, suggesting that some larger market participants rebalanced portfolios leading into the report. Let’s turn to Oracle’s chart to identify a potential upside target if the shares see an extended post-earnings rally and also point out a few support levels worth monitoring. Measured Move Upside Price Target Investors can project an upside target by using the measured move technique, also known by chart watchers as the measuring principle. When applying the analysis to Oracle’s chart, we calculate the stock’s strong uptrend that preceded the flag in points and add that amount to the pattern’s top trendline. For instance, we add $142 to $242, which projects a target of $384, implying an upside of nearly 60% from Tuesday’s closing price."

There are numerous AI stocks that investors can consider right now, and this list can serve as a starting point for further research on which AI stocks appear to be great buys. I've got 10 on my short list for top AI stocks to buy now, but there are likely many more beyond this. 1. Nvidia Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a leader in AI investing since its inception, primarily due to its industry-leading graphics processing units (GPUs), which have been widely utilized to train and run AI models. The company projects monster growth for its GPUs over the next five years, as it expects data center capital expenditures to rise from $600 billion this year to $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030. We'll see if this projection pans out, but there's still massive computing demand for AI, and Nvidia is the top provider in this segment. 2. Broadcom Another company heavily involved in this sector is Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO). Broadcom has two major products being used in AI data centers: its connectivity switches and its custom AI accelerators. The biggest growth story for Broadcom is these custom AI accelerators, which are alternatives to Nvidia's GPUs that are designed in conjunction with the end user. This could be a huge market for Broadcom, and makes me bullish on the stock. 3. Taiwan Semiconductor Neither Nvidia nor Broadcom can produce chips themselves, so they outsource the fabrication work of their designs to Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM). TSMC is the world's largest chip foundry and has established a reputation for continuous innovation and delivering best-in-class product yields. It's slated to capitalize on the massive AI arms race spending, regardless of which companies are using computing devices, making it an excellent AI investment on the chip side of AI. 4. ASML ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) is a key equipment supplier to chip foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor, as it holds a technological monopoly with its primary product: the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machine. This allows chip manufacturers to lay down microscopic electrical traces. Without ASML, none of the cutting-edge chip technology we know today would be possible. With the stock down about 30% from its all-time high (at the time of this writing), it appears to be a tremendous opportunity to scoop up while it's on sale. 5. Alphabet Moving to the AI hyperscaler side, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) looks like a strong investment. Although many assumed that Alphabet had fallen too far behind in the AI arms race to be a worthy competitor, it has emerged as one of the top players. Its generative AI model, Gemini, is one of the best available, and with Alphabet integrating it into its Google Search engine, it's easily one of the most used. Alphabet still trades at a discount to its big tech peers despite its recent success, and that could be a prime opportunity to make a profit over the next five years. 6. Meta Platforms Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is also heavily investing in AI. It's spent a ton of money hiring the best AI talent possible, and now it has reached a point where it's focusing that all-star lineup on various AI goals. Time will tell whether this is a winning strategy, but Meta is giving itself the best chance to succeed by equipping itself with the brightest minds to lead its various AI initiatives. 7. Amazon Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) may not be the first company you think of when you hear AI, but its cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is a huge part of the AI build-out trend. Most companies can't afford to build out a massive data center specifically for AI, so they rent it from a cloud computing provider like AWS. AWS is a significant contributor to Amazon's profitability, generating 53% of Amazon's operating profits in Q2, despite accounting for only 18% of revenue. Cloud computing has a massive tailwind blowing in its favor, and investing in companies with this business is a genius idea. 8. Microsoft AWS is the largest cloud computing provider, but Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure is quickly gaining ground. Azure has grown rapidly over the past few years, with its Q4 FY 2025 growth rate (ending June 30) coming in at 39%. That's far quicker than AWS's 17% growth rate, making Microsoft an interesting stock to watch in this space. 9. SoundHound AI SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) is quite a bit smaller than nearly every company on this list, but it's growing at a rapid pace. SoundHound AI's technology combines AI with audio recognition, which can be used to automate millions of jobs. In Q2, its revenue grew at a jaw-dropping 217% year-over-year pace, providing an incredibly bullish outlook for the future. Management believes they can deliver 50% organic growth for the foreseeable future, which would lead to an incredible stock performance. 10. The Trade Desk Last on this list is The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD), which has struggled lately. The stock is down over 60% from its all-time high because it's experiencing issues transitioning users from its old platform to its new AI-first platform, Kokai. However, The Trade Desk is well-positioned to capitalize on the digital ad market. Once it gets the transition on track, it will become a leading competitor in a rapidly growing space.

Shares of aerospace and defense company Rocket Lab (NASDAQ:RKLB) jumped 4.1% in the afternoon session after it got positive commentary from Wall Street, including a price target increase from Roth Capital. On Monday, Roth Capital raised its price target on the stock to $60 from $50, while maintaining a “Buy” rating. The analyst noted impressive progress toward the initial launch of the company's Neutron rocket and strong Q2 2025 results, which included record revenue and gross margin expansion. The firm's increased confidence in the Neutron program supports its bullish thesis for the stock. This optimistic sentiment is echoed across Wall Street, as other firms like Needham, Cantor Fitzgerald, and Keybanc also recently raised their price targets following the company's solid operational performance. After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $47.63, up 3.9% from previous close. Is now the time to buy Rocket Lab? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free. What Is The Market Telling Us Rocket Lab’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 75 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 13 days ago when the stock gained 3.7% on the news that the company announced it will receive a $23.9 million award under the CHIPS and Science Act and is opening its new Neutron launch complex this week. The stock's upward trend is fueled by a series of positive developments. The government funding is designated to expand U.S. manufacturing capacity for space-grade solar cells and electro-optical sensors, which are critical for national security missions. Adding to the bullish sentiment, Rocket Lab is also set to open its Neutron launch complex in Virginia, a key step toward the first flight of its larger, reusable rocket targeted for before the end of the year. The news follows the company's 70th successful Electron mission over the weekend and the recent acquisition of Geost, a developer of advanced sensor payloads, further enhancing its position as a key contractor for U.S. defense projects. Rocket Lab is up 90.8% since the beginning of the year, and at $47.63 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $51.39 from July 2025. Here at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth.

The stock has slipped nearly 18% from its recent high of $190, a sharp move lower that raises questions about whether it’s time to buy the dip. Even with the recent pullback, Palantir remains the year’s best performer in the S&P 500 Index ($SPX), soaring more than 107% since January. Moreover, it has increased by over 415% in the past 12 months. However, such dramatic gains raise valuation concerns, and here Palantir stands out in ways that could prompt even the most bullish investors to pause. More News from Barchart - Dear Broadcom Stock Fans, Mark Your Calendars for September 4 - CEO Alex Karp Just Sold $60 Million in Palantir Stock. Should You Ditch PLTR Here Too? Palantir Stock: The Valuation Concern Palantir’s price-sales ratio has skyrocketed to 133.2x, a level that not only dwarfs its peers in the artificial intelligence and software space, but also surpasses some of the largest and most profitable technology companies in the world. Snowflake (SNOW), UiPath (PATH), and C3.ai (AI), all prominent names in AI-driven software, trade at far more modest multiples of 17.9x, 4.1x, and 5.8x, respectively. Even the large tech giants with high profitability look inexpensive by comparison. For instance, Alphabet (GOOGL) stock trades at a P/S ratio of 7.2x, Microsoft (MSFT) at 13.3x, and Nvidia(NVDA), despite its dominance in the AI hardware space, trades at 34x. This stark contrast highlights the market’s lofty expectations for Palantir. Investors are effectively betting that the company will deliver explosive growth for years to come, justifying today’s price tag. So far, Palantir has given them reason to believe. Its government contracts remain robust, while its commercial business is expanding rapidly as more enterprises turn to AI-driven solutions. Palantir’s Strong Fundamentals Back the Rally For instance, Palantir just delivered one of its strongest quarters to date, surpassing $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time. The momentum in its business is accelerating, with overall revenue climbing 48% year-over-year in the second quarter. This surge comes as demand for its AI Platform (AIP) remains strong and is driving growth in its customer base. Every major metric of Palantir’s business remains solid, suggesting strong growth ahead. Palantir recorded its highest-ever bookings in Q2, with $2.3 billion in total contract value (TCV) and $684 million in annual contract value (ACV). Deal activity also remained robust, providing a solid platform for long-term growth.

Pieter Beens / Shutterstock.com Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), the world’s largest software company, is a key player in the AI industry. Its share price performance is also primarily driven by AI as the stock moves in tandem with investor expectations about the performance of its AI-centered cloud computing business. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s shares have gained 21% since Cramer’s October comments. All of these gains are due to a bullish run that kicked off in April and that has seen the stock gain 28% since then. The stock rose after Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s March quarter revenue and earnings beat analyst estimates. Crucially, the shares have also risen as the firm has delivered growth with its Azure cloud computing business, which is also responsible for delivering AI services to businesses. Here is what Cramer said about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in October 2024: “Microsoft’s supposed to be hurt by weakening demand for its Copilot, with its Copilot being their AI assistant. I have no idea if there’s a real weakness here but there is chatter and that’s enough to send the stock down.

Nvidia stock is expected to move approximately 6.2% in either direction by the end of the week, according to options pricing data. That big of a move from Tuesday's close would put shares at either $192.88, an all-time high that translates to a $4.7 trillion market capitalization, or $170.66, its lowest price since mid-July. Nvidia has reported earnings 10 times since the release of ChatGPT in late 2022 sparked the AI craze that’s made it the world’s most valuable company. The stock posted double-digit gains in the days after four of those reports, most recently in May 2024. But Nvidia’s earnings have struggled recently to clear the exceptionally high bar set by Wall Street. In the past four quarters, Nvidia stock has moved an average of 3.2% between reporting earnings and the end of the week. On only one of those occasions—the most recent report in May—did Nvidia finish the week above where it was before reporting earnings. Investors will be scrutinizing Nvidia’s report Wednesday for confirmation that AI demand remains strong. Hyperscalers Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN) all recently stood by plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars this year on data center infrastructure and other capital goods, citing robust demand for AI and cloud computing. Nvidia, with an estimated 80% to 90% share of the AI chip market, should be the biggest beneficiary of that spending. Wall Street will also be hoping for updates on sales to China. Nvidia warned in May that the Trump administration’s decision to tighten Biden-era export controls could cost it up to $8 billion in lost revenue in the second quarter. Earlier this month, Nvidia and competitor Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) struck a deal with the Trump administration that allows them to resume sales to China in exchange for a 15% cut. That deal came too late to have any impact on Wednesday’s results, but it should be factored into Nvidia’s guidance. Analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Nvidia. Of the 14 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha with current ratings on Nvidia’s stock, 13 rate it a “Buy” and one gives it a neutral “Hold” rating. The average price target of $203.38 is about 12% above Nvidia’s closing price on Tuesday. Update—August 26, 2025: This story has been updated with the latest options and share prices.

Today's US housing news was mixed. US Jul housing starts unexpectedly rose +5.2% m/m to a 5-month high of 1.428 million, stronger than expectations of a decline to 1.297 million. However, Jul building permits, a proxy for future construction, fell -2.8% m/m to a 5-year low of 1.354 million, weaker than expectations of -0.5% m/m to 1.386 million. Diplomatic talks over the war in Ukraine continue to make headway. Ukrainian President Zelenskiy said he came away with a commitment from President Trump late Monday to join security guarantees for any peace deal and reserve discussion on territorial swaps with Russia for later. The outcome of the talks could have macroeconomic implications regarding tariffs and oil prices, and could, of course, have significant consequences for European security. The focus of the markets this week will be on any new tariff news and signs of progress toward a Ukraine peace deal, with Ukrainian President Zelenskiy and European leaders continuing their meeting with President Trump in Washington. On Wednesday, the minutes of the July 29-30 FOMC meeting will be released. On Thursday, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to climb by +1,000 to 225,000 and the Aug Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey is expected to fall to 6.7 from 15.9 in July. Also, the Aug S&P manufacturing PMI is expected to remain unchanged at 49.8. In addition, Jul existing home sales are expected to fall -0.3% m/m to 3.92 million. On Friday, Fed Chair Powell speaks on the economic outlook at the Federal Reserve's annual symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Regarding tariffs, President Trump widened steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 consumer items that contain the metals, such as motorcycles, auto parts, furniture components, and tableware. The change went into effect on Monday and did not exclude goods already in transit. Last Friday, Mr. Trump said, ""I'll be setting tariffs next week and the week after on steel and on, I would say chips – chips and semiconductors, we'll be setting sometime next week, week after."" Mr. Trump last week said he planned a 100% tariff on semiconductors but would exempt companies that move chip manufacturing to the US. Mr. Trump also mentioned 200% or 300% tariffs on chips. In other recent tariff news, Mr. Trump last Tuesday extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November. On August 6, Mr. Trump announced that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil. On August 5, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced ""within the next week or so."" According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced. Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 84% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting, down from 93% last Thursday. The markets are discounting the chances at 53% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29. Earnings reports indicate that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With over 92% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, about 82% of companies exceeded profit estimates. Overseas stock markets today are mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 rose to a 4.75-month high and is up +0.92%. China's Shanghai Composite fell from a 10-year high and closed down -0.02%. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 retreated from a new record high and closed down -0.38%. Interest Rates September 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) today are up +6 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield is down -2.5 bp to 4.308%. Sep T-notes are moving higher today after S&P Global Ratings said that higher revenues from tariffs will help soften the blow to the US's fiscal health from the president's tax cuts, enabling the country to maintain its AA+ long-term credit rating. The weakness in stocks today is also supporting safe-haven demand for T-notes. Gains in T-notes are limited due to concerns that last week's bearish US July CPI and PPI reports could keep the Fed from cutting interest rates at next month's FOMC meeting. European government bond yields today are moving lower. The 10-year German bund yield is down -1.4 bp to 2.749%. The 10-year UK gilt yield fell from a 2.5-month high of 4.756% and is down by -2.2 bp to 4.716%. Swaps are discounting the chances at 6% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.

""If NVDA were to include China in its guidance, we believe it would contribute an incremental $2-3 billion in revenue,"" KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh wrote in a new note. Vinh expects strong Q2 results, driven by demand for Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs, when the chipmaker reports on Wednesday. But he warned that guidance for Q3 could be conservative, given uncertainty around US export licenses to China. Still, KeyBanc reiterated its Overweight rating and lifted its price target to $215 from $190, pointing to Nvidia's central role in the AI boom and supply-demand dynamics that remain firmly in its favor. Nvidia's near-term growth story looks solid without China. Supply of Nvidia's Blackwell B200 GPU jumped 40% in Q2 and could rise another 20% in Q3, according to Vinh. Simultaneously, shipments of the more advanced Blackwell Ultra (B300) are ramping up, reinforcing Nvidia's dominance in AI chips. KeyBanc raised its full-year shipment forecast for Nvidia's rack-sale AI systems, known as GB200. The firm now expects 30,000 units to ship this year, up from 25,000 previously, citing stronger yields and improved supply-chain execution. For now, KeyBanc assumes Nvidia will exclude China revenue from its guidance. That mirrors the approach of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which earlier this month left China out of its outlook amid the same regulatory uncertainty. The Chinese impact on Nvidia is significant. KeyBanc raised its Q2 revenue estimate to $47.1 billion from $45.1 billion, above Wall Street’s consensus of $45.7 billion. It raised earnings per share to $1.05 from $0.99, slightly above consensus of $1.00. But with Nvidia agreeing to pay 15% of Chinese chip sales to the US government, plus China's push for domestic AI chips, the company is likely to adopt a more conservative stance on its financial forecast. For Q3, KeyBanc cut its revenue estimates to $50.4 billion from $53.5 billion, versus a consensus of $52.6 billion. EPS was clipped to $1.14 from $1.22, below the Street's consensus of $1.19. Longer term, KeyBanc trimmed fiscal 2026 forecasts on China risks, but boosted 2027 expectations on stronger rack shipments due to accelerating spending by hyperscalers like Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOG). Wall Street remains bullish. Morgan Stanley recently called Nvidia the most undervalued megacap stock in the market. Its shares are up more than 30% year to date and over 35% in the past 12 months."

More News from Barchart - Why This Cannabis Penny Stock Could Be Wall Street’s Next Meme Trade Breakout - Peter Thiel-Backed Bullish Is About to IPO. Should You Buy BLSH Stock? Arista Networks’ Q2 Results Arista Networks specializes in networking solutions for data centers and other enterprise clients. The company is known for its high-performance switching platforms, advanced automation, analytics, and security capabilities. Arista Networks reported a record-breaking Q2 2025, with revenue jumping 30.4% year-over-year to $2.2 billion, beating analyst estimates of $2.11 billion. Non-GAAP EPS reached $0.73, exceeding the expected $0.65, while non-GAAP net income surged 37.3% to $923.5 million. Non-GAAP operating margin improved to 47%, and operating income surpassed $ 1 billion for the first time, underscoring exceptional efficiency and scale.

a966ac938612773de305f620065d060dd1590d349f385996577cbe76db9dcd63,MSFT,From Tech to Real Estate : Top Stocks to Ride the 2025 Rate Cut Wave ! ,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-real-estate-top-stocks-140002158.html,finance.yahoo.com,20250812T223000Z,semi,0.65,"Interest rates and stock market performance often move in opposite directions, shaping investment strategies for professional traders and investors. When rates climb, stocks tend to dip as borrowing costs rise and bonds gain appeal. When rates fall, stocks typically rally as cheaper capital fuels corporate growth and consumer spending. Recently, I wrote an article for Barchart, ""Don't Panic on Nasdaq Dips: Leverage Seasonal Trends for Smarter Trades"". The opening paragraph stated, ""The August employment report, released on August 1, showed 73,000 jobs added, missing expectations of 102,000, with significant downward revisions of 258,000 jobs for May and June, bringing the three-month average to 35,000, the lowest since May 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)."" The report immediately changed the outlook for interest rate cuts at upcoming FOMC meetings. The probability of a 25 basis point cut at the September meeting is now 95.1%. By the December meeting, the CME Fed Watch tool is projecting a 54.3% that rates could be at 3.50-3.75%. If this aggressive rate-cutting comes to fruition, there could be some excellent opportunities for traders, investors, and consumers. Interest rates dictate borrowing costs, directly impacting corporate and consumer behavior. Higher rates increase the cost of capital, limiting business expansion and squeezing cash flows, which can depress stock prices. Meanwhile, bonds become more attractive for their steady yields. Conversely, lower rates reduce borrowing costs, enabling companies to invest in growth and consumers to spend more freely on big-ticket items like homes or vehicles. This dynamic often sparks stock market gains, particularly in rate-sensitive sectors. While the broader economy may take 12-18 months to reflect rate changes fully, markets react faster. Traders price in expectations well before Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decisions, creating short-term volatility and opportunities. The federal funds rate, which governs overnight lending between banks, sets the tone. The markets are already adjusting for a lower-rate environment. Historically, rate cuts signal economic stimulus. In 2020, post-COVID cuts to near-zero rates spurred a 50% S&P 500 rally within six months. Lower rates reduce the cost of debt, boosting corporate profits and consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 68% of U.S. GDP. Sectors tied to borrowing, spending, or stable cash flows—like consumer discretionary, technology, real estate, financials, and utilities—tend to outperform in such cycles. Consumer Discretionary (XLY) Low rates fuel consumer discretionary outperformance by reducing financing costs for purchases like vehicles, electronics, or travel. With disposable income rising, consumers are poised to spend more as borrowing becomes cheaper. Companies with strong e-commerce or experiential offerings stand to gain the most. Stock to Consider: Amazon (AMZN) Amazon's diversified revenue streams—e-commerce, AWS, and advertising—position it to capitalize on increased consumer spending. In Q2 2025, AWS revenue grew 17.5% year-over-year, while advertising hit $15.7 billion. With a forward P/E of 38, AMZN offers growth at a reasonable valuation for a tech giant. Risk: Rising logistics costs could pressure margins if fuel prices spike. Technology (XLK) Tech thrives in low-rate environments as cheaper capital funds innovation and expansion. The XLK ETF has historically gained over the six months after the rate cuts. With AI and cloud computing driving demand, tech firms with strong balance sheets are well-positioned for the remainder of 2025. Stock to Consider: Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft's cloud segment (Azure) grew 31% year-over-year in Q2 2025, fueled by AI infrastructure demand. MSFT balances growth and stability with a forward P/E of 32, August 2025, with a 0.8% dividend yield. MSFT has now exceeded $4 trillion market cap. MSFT continues trading near all-time highs. Real Estate (XLRE) Lower rates reduce mortgage and financing costs, boosting demand for residential and commercial properties. The XLRE ETF has increased returns in the year following rate cuts. Lower rates could accelerate real estate activity. Stock to Consider: Prologis (PLD) Prologis, a logistics REIT, benefits from e-commerce-driven warehouse demand. Q2 2025 occupancy hit 95.1%, with rental income up 9.9%. Trading at a forward P/FFO in the mid-20s, PLD offers a 2.8% dividend yield. Watch industrial leasing trends; softening demand in oversupplied markets could cap upside. During the 2020-2023 low interest rate cycle, the stock price was low at $60 and rallied to $175. Financials (XLF) Low rates spur lending and trading activity, boosting bank profits. The XLF ETF has historically outperformed the S&P 500 in rate-cut cycles. Financials would be primed for gains if the FOMC follows through on its rate cuts. Stock to Consider: JPMorgan Chase (JPM) JPMorgan's diversified operations—commercial banking, wealth management, and trading—deliver consistent earnings. Aggressive rate cuts have historically elevated stock market participation, which would be bullish for JPM. Utilities (XLU) Utilities shine in low-rate, slow-growth environments due to stable demand and high debt loads. This is because utilities are capital-intensive and benefit from lower borrowing costs. Stock to Consider: NRG Energy (NRG) NRG has a significant presence in retail energy, selling electricity and gas directly to residential and commercial customers. NRG has expanded its renewable energy portfolio, including solar and wind assets. The company aims to generate relatively steady cash flows from these segments. Any new regulatory shifts toward clean energy could drive growth.NRG continues to trade near its all-time high even after the new administration took office. In Closing… Rate cuts in the latter half of 2025 could unlock significant upside for consumer discretionary, technology, real estate, financials, and utilities. By focusing on fundamentally strong ETFs and stocks like AMZN, MSFT, PLD, JPM, and NRG, traders can position for growth while managing risks. Stay vigilant for macroeconomic shifts, particularly inflation or geopolitical surprises, that could alter the Fed's trajectory. With disciplined analysis, these sectors offer actionable opportunities for professional traders and investors.

You never know when a CEO of a major company is going to mention another business or progress in an innovative field. Microsoft's (MSFT 0.50%) CEO Satya Nadella recently gave some commentary regarding quantum computing, and it could have huge ramifications for companies involved in the field, like IonQ (IONQ -3.92%). Microsoft believes quantum computing will be a huge boost for one of its primary businesses, which could lead to major growth for IonQ. Microsoft is bullish on quantum computing viability During Microsoft's fourth quarter of fiscal-year 2025 (ending June 30) conference call, Nadella stated: ""The next big accelerator in the cloud will be Quantum, and I am excited about our progress."" Following that statement, he discussed how Microsoft recently launched a Level 2 quantum computer, which he describes as a device with reliable logical qubits. While Microsoft is pursuing quantum computing technology, it also supports another business in the field. Microsoft has long taken the stance in the cloud computing realm of staying neutral. That's why it offers several of the leading AI models on its platform, beyond its partners. While it's pursuing quantum computing by itself, it also has IonQ's quantum computing platform available for use. This is key for a company like IonQ, as all three of the major cloud players are attempting to develop their own quantum computing technology. This could ease barriers to entry, but IonQ already has its quantum hardware available on Microsoft's Azure, Alphabet's Google Cloud, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). If quantum computing ends up being the next big thing for cloud computing and IonQ can beat the competition to the punch, it could enjoy a role similar to Nvidia, which is a great place to be. I think IonQ has what it takes to reach that spot, as it has a few key advantages over its competition. IonQ is taking a unique approach to quantum computing Nearly every company in the quantum computing race is taking the same approach: superconducting. This requires cooling a particle to near absolute zero, which is a very expensive proposition. IonQ's trapped ion approach eliminates the need for this, as it can be done at room temperature. Additionally, the trapped ion approach may provide increased error correction due to the ability to connect every qubit in the system. Right now, IonQ is the industry leader, as it holds the current world record in both one-qubit and two-qubit fidelity (a measure of how accurate a calculation is). IonQ has also laid out a path to building devices with 2 million qubits by 2030, which doubles the 1 million qubits that most companies agree is the minimum amount necessary for quantum computing to achieve commercial relevance. If IonQ can win the quantum computing race, there's a huge market opportunity available. Management projects that the total addressable market will be about $87 billion by 2035 -- a massive market considering IonQ's small size. I think IonQ is one of the best pure-play quantum computing investments that investors can make right now, but that doesn't mean investors should go all-in. There's still a ton of risk involved with IonQ's stock, so investors need to keep their exposure relatively minimal. By devoting no more than 1% of total portfolio value to IonQ, investors won't feel the pain if the stock goes to $0. But if it explodes, that 1% exposure will be all you need to make a massive profit on the investment."

It did that after the stock jumped about 4% following earnings. The reason why Microsoft jumped is incredible and represents a significant shift in Microsoft's business.

Microsoft saw strength from nearly every division in Q4 Microsoft is a tech conglomerate with an incredibly broad product lineup ranging from cloud solutions to software to hardware. Normally, one or even two business segments have rough quarters while cloud services push Microsoft's overall business higher; however, all three performed phenomenally in Microsoft's fiscal fourth quarter of 2025 (ending June 30). Over the past few years, the weakest division has been its More Personal Computing segment, which houses gaming devices (the Xbox) and other Microsoft-branded hardware. Revenue was up 9% year over year, which is a very strong result historically for this segment. Productivity and Business Processes houses the Microsoft products you're likely most familiar with, like Office and LinkedIn. This segment crushed it, with revenue rising 16% year over year. That's by far the best quarter this segment has produced during FY 2025, as Q3 revenue growth in this segment was 10%, Q2's was 14%, and Q1's was 12%. If Microsoft's more mature business units can deliver strong growth, it bodes well for the rest of the company, as cloud products once again led the way in Q4. Azure's growth rate is rapidly accelerating We still haven't got to the most impressive part of Microsoft's business yet, the Intelligent Cloud division. This segment rose 21% year over year, which is in line with its performance in previous quarters. However, the star of the show is Azure, Microsoft's cloud computing service. Cloud computing is rising in popularity for a few reasons. First, for traditional business workloads like data processing or information storage, it offers a cost-effective solution. Rather than keep them on expensive company servers that require maintenance or can be expensive to scale up or down, more clients are choosing to offload this work onto the cloud, with Azure being one of the top options. It's also a smart choice for training and building AI models. Most companies don't need an AI supercomputer at all times. Furthermore, the cost of building one of these units makes it increasingly prohibitive. However, Azure offers high-powered computing necessary for training AI models on the cloud, and this has become an increasingly popular option among many AI start-ups. Azure's growth rate rapidly accelerated from previous quarters, which is a very bullish sign for Microsoft's business. Azure's jaw-dropping 39% year over year growth rate is much quicker than in previous quarters. This strength is expected to persist for some time, and Microsoft's CFO Amy Hood stated that ""demand remains higher than supply."" Microsoft Azure is a huge part of the company's investment thesis, and its continued success bodes well for investors. Although Microsoft's stock is expensive, it's still a top operator in the space and makes for a solid AI stock pick right now."

On July 29, ahead of the release of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings report, Bernstein SocGen Group reaffirmed its Outperform rating and $540 price target for the company’s shares. Pixabay/Public Domain Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was set to reveal its quarterly results on July 30 after market close, following what Bernstein calls a “surprisingly strong” third quarter that included outstanding overall performance and notable growth in Azure cloud services. Despite the improvement in market mood, the firm pointed out that concerns about Azure growth, capital expenditures, the OpenAI alliance, and general fundamentals still exist. Beyond the published statistics, Bernstein cited four significant topics of concern for investors: high-level guidance for fiscal year 2026, Azure performance and capital expenditures, further remarks on the OpenAI alliance, and the AI revenue run rate leaving Q4. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a leading technology company known for its core software products, which include the Windows OS, Microsoft 365 suite, and Edge browser. Its product portfolio includes corporate software, software development tools, video games, gaming gear, and cloud services. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) fell -0.43%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) fell -0.60%. Stock indexes gave up an early advance on Thursday and settled lower, with the Dow Jones Industrials falling to a 2-week low. ARM Holdings Plc plunged more than -13% to weigh on chip stocks after the company forecast Q2 adjusted EPS below the consensus. Also, pharmaceutical companies retreated Thursday to weigh on the overall market after President Trump sent letters to 17 drug makers, demanding they slash drug prices. Stocks on Thursday initially moved higher, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 posting new record highs. Stellar earnings results from Microsoft and Meta Platforms lifted the broader market early Thursday after they boosted their capital spending plans and pledged to continue investing in artificial intelligence. Thursday's economic news was mixed for stocks as reports showed a resilient labor market, although consumer spending was weaker than expected and price pressures and labor costs remained sticky. US weekly initial unemployment claims rose +1,000 to 218,000, showing a stronger labor market than expectations of 224,000. US Jun personal spending rose +0.3% m/m, weaker than expectations of +0.4% m/m. Jun personal income rose +0.3% m/m, stronger than expectations of +0.2% m/m. The US Jun core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, rose +2.8% y/y, stronger than expectations of +2.7% y/y. The US Q2 employment cost index rose +0.9%, stronger than expectations of +0.8%. The US Jul MNI Chicago PMI rose +6.7 to a four-month high 47.1, stronger than expectations of 42.0. In the latest tariff news, President Trump said Thursday that he will impose a tariff rate of 15% on imports from South Korea and that a deal with Taiwan was also being drafted as the two countries reached ""a certain degree of consensus."" In addition, trade deals are in the offing for Thailand and Cambodia after they agreed to a ceasefire. Finally, President Trump extended Mexico's current tariff rates for 90 days to allow more time for trade negotiations. The markets this week will focus on any news of new trade deals before Friday's deadline. On Friday, Jul nonfarm payrolls are expected to increase by +109,000, and the Jul unemployment rate is expected to rise by +0.1 to 4.2%. Also, Jul average hourly earnings are expected +0.3% m/m and +3.8% y/y. In addition, the Jul ISM manufacturing index is expected to increase by +0.2 to 49.5. Finally, the University of Michigan Jul consumer sentiment index is expected to be unrevised at 61.8. The markets are awaiting President Trump's August 1 deadline for trade deals to avoid high tariffs. On July 16, Mr. Trump announced that he intends to send a tariff letter to more than 150 countries, notifying them that their tariff rates could be 10% or 15%, effective August 1. As an update, Mr. Trump last Wednesday said, ""We'll have a straight, simple tariff of anywhere between 15% and 50%,"" an indication that the floor for tariffs is rising and suggesting that he would not go below 15%. Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 42% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting and 36% at the following meeting on October 28-29. This week kicks off the earnings season's busiest week, with 38% of the stocks in the S&P 500 reporting quarterly earnings, double the amount reported last week. The earnings results of Magnificent Seven members will be front and center, with Apple and Amazon.com reporting after today's closing. Early results show that S&P 500 earnings are on track to rise +4.5% for the second quarter, better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With over 55% of S&P 500 firms having reported, around 82% exceeded profit estimates. Overseas stock markets on Thursday settled mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 fell from a 2.5-week high and closed down -1.36%. China's Shanghai Composite slid to a 1-week low and closed down -1.18%. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +1.02%. Interest Rates September 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) Thursday closed up +2 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield fell -0.6 bp to 4.365%. T-notes posted modest gains on Thursday due to some positive carryover from a rally in 10-year UK gilts to a 3.5-week high. Also, falling inflation expectations were supportive for T-notes after the 10-year breakeven inflation rate fell to a 1-week low Thursday of 2.381%. In addition, month-end buying of longer-term government debt securities by bond fund managers to extend duration and balance their bond portfolios was supportive for T-notes. T-notes fell back from their best levels after weekly jobless claims rose less than expected, and the Q2 employment cost index and the Jun core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, rose more than expected, hawkish factors for Fed policy. In addition, T-notes have some negative carryover from Wednesday when Fed Chair Powell dampened speculation of a Fed rate cut in September when he said that with inflation risks from tariffs, the current modestly restrictive policy stance is appropriate. European government bond yields today are moving lower. The 10-year German bund yield is down -1.0 bp to 2.695%. The 10-year UK gilt yield fell to a 3.5-week low of 4.557% and is down -3.5 bp to 4.567%.

The German Jul unemployment change rose by +2,000, showing a stronger labor market than expectations of +15,000. German Jul CPI (EU harmonized) eased to +1.8% y/y from +2.0% y/y in Jun, weaker than expectations of +1.9% y/y and the slowest pace of increase in 10 months. Swaps are discounting the chances at 10% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.

But after the earnings mic-drop that Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) have delivered, it might be time to upgrade that terminology… This week, two of the world’s biggest tech titans gave investors a thunderous wake-up call: AI’s fires are burning even brighter. And if you thought AI stocks were already hot, buckle up – because the next 12 to 24 months could be an inferno of growth, innovation, and outsized investment returns. This has surpassed a mere ‘boom.’ We’ve arrived at ‘supernova.’ Let’s break down those earnings – and why it confirms the AI trade still has plenty of profits to deliver. Meta Earnings: How AI Supercharged Revenue, Engagement, and Margins In our opinion, Meta’s second-quarter earnings report was a pure flex. This was a “we told you so” moment from Mark Zuckerberg to every investor who doubted the company’s pivot toward AI. - Revenue rose 22%, the company’s best growth rate in over a year. - Ad revenue grew 21%, also an acceleration and the best in a year. - Operating margins expanded by 500 basis points. - Earnings per share (EPS) jumped nearly 40%. Those are blockbuster numbers by any historical standard; but they’re especially impressive for a company already valued at $1.3 trillion. And driving all this explosive growth? You guessed it: AI. Meta has quietly become one of the most powerful AI companies on Earth. Its AI-powered recommendation engine is now responsible for filling the majority of content on Facebook and Instagram, which has led to meaningfully better engagement. Time spent on Facebook grew 5% in the quarter. Instagram saw even better numbers, with engagement up 6%. The company’s AI tools are also supercharging ad performance, capitalizing on all that monetizable attention. Facebook ad conversion rates rose 3%. Instagram’s rose 5%. That’s enormous in the world of digital advertising. AI-generated ad creation is gaining traction fast, with Zuckerberg noting that a “meaningful percent” of Q2 revenue came from ads made using Meta’s generative AI tools. Meta’s $100B AI Pivot Meanwhile, Meta AI itself – its consumer-facing chatbot – has surpassed 1 billion monthly active users. And Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses are flying off the shelves, with sales tripling over the year. Demand continues to outpace supply. And the cherry on top? Meta is turning this growth into profits without growing headcount. That’s the AI efficiency dividend at work. Operating margins are expanding. Profits are exploding. And they’re not letting up. Meta raised the low end of its 2025 capex guidance and introduced an eye-popping forecast for 2026: over $100 billion in capex. Wall Street’s estimate was just $80 billion. That’s a 25% beat. Four years ago, in 2021, capex was under $20 billion. That reflects a 5x jump in five years. In other words, Meta is all-in on AI, and it’s paying off. Yet, the stock still trades at just 23x forward earnings. Given these numbers, we think that’s a bargain. Azure, Copilot, and the AI Stack: Microsoft’s Growth Formula Microsoft reported a monster quarter of its own – arguably even more AI-fueled than Meta’s. - Revenue jumped 17%, the company’s fastest growth in over a year. - Azure cloud revenues surged 39%, the best growth since mid-2022. - Operating margins rose 200 basis points. - EPS soared 24%. Every metric screamed “acceleration.” And again, AI was the common denominator. While it once was just dipping its toes into the AI pool, Microsoft is now doing cannonballs. Its AI data platform, Microsoft Fabric, grew revenues by 55% and is now the fastest-growing database product in Microsoft history. GitHub Copilot Enterprise users grew 75% in one quarter. Microsoft Copilot now boasts over 100 million monthly users. In fact, more than 800 million people globally now use a Microsoft AI product every month. Even the company’s healthcare AI platform, Dragon Copilot, is on fire, with 13 million physician-patient encounters in Q2 – a 7x increase year-over-year. Like Meta, Microsoft achieved all this while keeping headcount flat. It added no new people to the payroll but still grew revenue by double digits. Talk about AI-powered operating leverage… And the spending story is just as bullish. Microsoft offered guidance for $30 billion in capex next quarter, also about 25% higher than what Wall Street was expecting. Meta and Microsoft’s AI Capex Could Be a Windfall for Suppliers Now, here’s the signal we think you really want to pay attention to: Meta and Microsoft – two of the largest AI builders on the planet – just told us they’re spending 25% more on AI infrastructure than Wall Street was anticipating. Meta is on pace to spend $100-plus billion in 2026. Microsoft is projecting $30 billion in AI capex next quarter alone. We don’t think these are one-off spikes. More likely, they are part of a sustained arms race to build the AI stack of the future. That means an absolute torrent of money is about to flow into AI infrastructure: data centers, chips, cooling systems, power grids, optics, networking hardware, and more. That means that if you’re holding the picks-and-shovels plays – names like Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), Arista Networks (ANET), Vertiv (VRT), Super Micro (SMCI), or even specialized power providers like Eaton (ETN) and nVent (NVT) – you’re positioned directly in the slipstream of the world’s biggest spending spree. Why AI Stocks May Still Be Early in the Profit Curve Wall Street tends to call tops prematurely. And the AI trade has gotten so hot, so fast that skeptics around the world are screaming, “bubble!” But in reality, the fundamentals are catching up – and surpassing – the seemingly outsized hype. Meta and Microsoft aren’t trading on promises. They’re delivering real revenue and profit growth and margin expansion right now thanks to AI. And they’re doing it at an unprecedented scale. The two just gave us a clear signal that: - AI adoption is going mainstream with consumers and enterprises. - AI is already delivering stronger-than-expected ROI already. - AI infrastructure spending is climbing much faster than forecasted. - And AI-powered revenue and profit growth is showing up in a big way. Even more importantly, they’re not done. Get Ready for a Supernova of AI Profits Both companies are aggressively reinvesting in the next wave of AI infrastructure and applications. Meta aims to build AGI. Microsoft is flooding the enterprise world with highly capable agentic AI. Folks, this is just the beginning… meaning it’s time to lean in. The next 12 to 24 months will be defined by relentless innovation, explosive spending, and the proliferation of AI across every layer of the economy. Investors who stay long – and especially those who get positioned in the companies providing the picks and shovels – stand to benefit the most. We don’t think these titans’ message could get more explicit: AI is no longer the future. It’s the now. And the smart money is going all-in. But if the AI boom is the infrastructure play of the decade, humanoid robotics may be the next layer of exponential upside. And one company appears uniquely positioned to lead it: Tesla (TSLA). Its Optimus robot is now more than a science project. It’s a functional machine – one with real-world applications that could generate billions in revenue. Yet, while Tesla may steal the headlines, the fattest margins – and the most explosive stock gains – could flow to the companies quietly building the parts powering these bots."

Investors have been bullish ahead of the results, driving the stock to a record high of $518.29 on July 25. So far in 2025, shares are up a robust 21.5%, powered by strong demand for Microsoft’s cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) offerings. This recent rally has pushed Microsoft’s valuation higher. However, analysts remain confident there’s still room for upside, especially as global demand for cloud services and generative AI solutions continues to accelerate. More News from Barchart - Here’s What Happened the Last Time Novo Nordisk Stock Was This Oversold - Tesla Just Signed a Chip Supply Deal with Samsung. What Does That Mean for TSLA Stock? Recent quarterly results from Alphabet (GOOGL), which reported robust growth in its own cloud and AI solutions, have only added to the positive sentiment surrounding Microsoft. Like Alphabet, Microsoft is deeply embedded in the AI and enterprise cloud landscape, and it’s benefiting from similar tailwinds. For instance, Microsoft Cloud brought in more than $42 billion in revenue in Q3, a 22% increase. This reflected strong and growing demand for its solutions. Furthermore, Microsoft’s AI portfolio is also gaining traction, with its AI-related revenue climbing steadily. The company has also been aggressively expanding its infrastructure to meet this rising demand. Its ongoing investments in data center capacity are designed to keep pace with the AI boom and ensure it can support future growth. In short, Microsoft’s leadership in both AI and cloud will continue to pay dividends in Q4, driving its financials. With strong tailwinds behind it, Microsoft could once again deliver solid quarterly revenue and earnings. Microsoft Q4 Earnings: Cloud and AI Set to Lead Growth Microsoft is poised to report another strong quarter, with its fourth-quarter financials expected to reflect continued momentum mainly driven by its cloud and AI offerings. In the Productivity and Business Processes segment, Microsoft anticipates revenue between $32.05 billion and $32.35 billion, representing double-digit growth. This growth is expected to be supported by steady demand for Microsoft 365 (M365) Commercial cloud services. Revenue in this category is projected to rise around 14%, with average revenue per user benefiting from greater adoption of premium offerings such as E5 and AI-enhanced M365 Copilot. Additionally, small and medium-sized businesses continue to drive the expansion of Microsoft’s customer base."

As reports of the exploit surfaced, investors rushed into names they believe are best positioned to combat these evolving threats. SentinelOne (S) was among the biggest winners, surging 8% in midday trading on July 21. The company’s advanced Singularity Platform, powered by AI and built to secure endpoints, cloud workloads, and identity systems, has drawn renewed investor confidence. Peers like CrowdStrike (CRWD), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), and Fortinet (FTNT) also saw strong upside. More News from Barchart But among them, SentinelOne’s aggressive innovation and autonomous threat response tech have set it apart. So, as cyber risks mount and investor interest heats up, the question now is: Is SentinelOne stock a buy, sell, or hold? Let’s dig in. About SentinelOne Stock Based in California, SentinelOne is a leading cybersecurity firm known for its AI-powered Singularity Platform. The Singularity Platform provides autonomous threat prevention and response capabilities. Its platform is designed to offer comprehensive visibility and protection across endpoints, cloud workloads, and identity credentials. SentinelOne’s focus on an AI-driven approach, combined with its ability to provide a unified cybersecurity solution, sets it apart from many competitors who may rely on more traditional, manual threat management techniques.

After hitting a 52-week high of $29.29 in November 2024, the stock has dropped about 11% year-to-date, pressured by a lowered full-year revenue outlook and mounting competition in the crowded cybersecurity landscape. In terms of valuation, SentinelOne trades at 7.9x forward sales, well below peers like CrowdStrike at 29x and Palo Alto Networks at 16.6x. Given its strong growth and AI-driven edge, this discounted valuation supports bullish sentiment and reflects its unique niche in autonomous cybersecurity. SentinelOne Q1 Revenue Surges, Yet the Company Lowers Outlook On May 28, SentinelOne posted its first quarter results for fiscal year 2026, which showed robust growth with mixed profitability.

The 2025 GenAI Public Cloud Survey has revealed that Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is the second-place choice for companies considering additional cloud providers. Survey results demonstrate that Google Cloud Platform, or GCP, had a solid showing.

He had already become the wealthiest person in the world, reaching centibillionaire status briefly in 1999. He slowly stepped back from the company he founded over the next 20 years, ultimately resigning from its board in 2020. Gates' focus over the last 25 years has shifted from building a leading technology company to solving some of the world's toughest health, equality, and educational challenges through the Gates Foundation. In that time, he and ex-wife Melinda French Gates donated about $60 billion of their wealth, making them two of the biggest donors in history. Their philanthropic giving is only outdone by Gates' friend Warren Buffett, who has been a longtime donor to his foundation. While Gates' fortune was built on Microsoft, he's mostly followed Buffett's investing style when it comes to his personal portfolio and that of the Gates Foundation trust fund. Buffett is a big proponent of the idea of putting a lot of your capital to work in just a few outstanding companies. As a result, over two-thirds of the Gates Foundation's trust's marketable equity portfolio is held in just three marvelous stocks all reflecting the combined influence of Gates and Buffett. 1. Microsoft (33%) The majority of Gates' wealth comes from his stake in Microsoft, the company he co-founded in 1975. After his most recent donation to the Gates Foundation in 2022, Gates' stake in the company fell to less than 1%. Of course, 1% of a $4 trillion company is still $40 billion. The Gates Foundation still holds a significant stake in Microsoft as well, even though it regularly sells shares to fund its operations. As of its most recent 13-F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Gates Foundation held 28.5 million shares of Microsoft. Those shares are worth $14.8 billion as of this writing. Microsoft's seeing strong results across its cloud computing business, Azure, as well as its core enterprise software. Both are benefiting from growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI). Azure is now a $75 billion business, up 34% over the past year, generating a strong operating margin for Microsoft. Not only that, but Azure revenue is accelerating, as demand continues to outstrip supply. Microsoft is investing tens of billions of dollars in building capacity for AI training and inference. On the software side of the business, management is seeing strong adoption of its Copilot AI agent. Management said it surpassed 100 million monthly active users across its family of Copilot apps. Moreover, its Copilot Studio, which enables businesses to harness their own data to develop custom AI agents, saw customers create 3 million new agents over the past year. That's resulted in revenue acceleration over the past year (up 18% last quarter) as well as margin expansion. Earnings per share climbed an impressive 24% last quarter. While the stock responded positively, increased earnings expectations for the stock mean shares trade for about 34 times earnings estimates. That's an attractive price for the stock with accelerating earnings growth and tens of billions in quarterly free cash flow it can use to invest in future opportunities or return to shareholders. 2. Berkshire Hathaway (17%) Warren Buffett makes an annual donation of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.77%) (BRK.B 0.78%) shares to the Gates Foundation every summer. Buffett earmarked 10 million Class B shares for the foundation in 2006, or 500 million shares after adjusting for splits. Every year, Buffett donates 5% of the remaining earmarked shares as long as the Gates Foundation's total giving from the previous year is equal to the amount donated in the previous year plus 5% of the foundation's other assets. Despite that stipulation, the foundation has managed to hold onto a good chunk of Berkshire shares. It counted 17.2 million shares as of the end of March this year. Those shares are worth about $7.9 billion as of this writing. The foundation received another 9.4 million shares on June 30, according to SEC filings. Shares of Berkshire Hathaway suffered since the company's annual meeting in May, when Buffett announced his resignation as CEO effective Jan. 1. While some of that is due to a loss of the ""Buffett premium"" some shareholders may have put on Berkshire Hathaway, the company has also faced some challenges. The insurance business saw outstanding results in 2024, but that's normalized in 2025. Price increases haven't added meaningful revenue while increases in payouts in the first quarter led to worse underwriting results. Additionally, Buffett hasn't seen very many opportunities to invest Berkshire's capital, leading him to leave a lot of cash on the sidelines even as stock prices continue to rise. In fact, Buffett's been a net seller of stocks for 11 consecutive quarters. Berkshire ended the second quarter with $344 billion in cash and equivalents, significantly more in value than its marketable equities. Buffett hasn't even found Berkshire shares particularly attractive, passing on the opportunity to buy back shares with Berkshire's cash hoard. Even after the pullback in price, shares trade for roughly 1.5 times book value. That's around the valuation where Buffett initially stopped repurchasing shares. However, if the stock falls meaningfully below that 1.5-times-book-value threshold, Buffett might resume buying shares, and investors should consider buying up the stock at that price as well. Berkshire's operations remain strong and the opportunity for Buffett or his team of investment managers to make a move with $344 billion at their disposal holds a lot of potential value. 3. Waste Management (17%) Waste Management (WM 1.03%) is a boring stock that the Gates Foundation Trust has held in its portfolio for decades. In fact, it's added to its stake in the company, and it now holds 35.2 million shares (up from 1.2 million shares in 2002). Those shares are worth about $7.5 billion as of this writing. The waste collection and disposal company has seen strong organic growth over the last few years, with revenue climbing 6% per year from 2022 through 2024. That's continued in 2025, growing 5.4% in its most recent quarter. On top of that organic growth, management has made strategic acquisitions that have been accretive. Its most recent acquisition, Stericycle, pushed Waste Management into the medical waste space. Rebranded as WM Healthcare Solutions, the business contributed about 10% of Waste Management net operating revenue in the second quarter. The company managed to produce strong operating margins despite taking on the lower-margin medical waste business. Last quarter's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin of 29.9% was essentially in line with last year's margin without the Healthcare Solutions business. As management unlocks synergies in the acquisition and scales the business, it should see strong improvements in profitability over time. That margin expansion is supported by Waste Management's incomparable position in the industry thanks to its landfill portfolio. New entrants face high barriers to entry as regulatory hurdles make it impractical to develop new landfills. Additionally, Waste Management's scale gives it a better margin profile as it's able to develop denser routes and benefit from economies of scale. Despite Waste Management's dominant position in the industry, the stock trades at a lower valuation than its two biggest competitors. At an enterprise value of 15 times forward EBITDA estimates, it's a fair price to pay for a company with expanding EBITDA margins and strong organic revenue growth."

The momentum has only accelerated in 2025, with the stock climbing 136.8% year-to-date, compared with XLK’s more modest 19.6% rise. Technically, the rally shows no signs of losing steam. PLTR has maintained a position above its 200-day moving average for the entire past year and has traded mostly above its 50-day moving average since late April, underscoring a strong and sustained uptrend. On Sept. 23, shares of Palantir Technologies climbed over 1% after the U.S. Treasury Department awarded the company a new contract centered on strengthening data integrity and enhancing technical infrastructure. The deal underscores Palantir’s growing role as a trusted government technology partner, reinforcing its reputation for delivering advanced data analytics and infrastructure solutions. Its rival, Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), has lagged behind, with its shares rising 20.3% on a YTD basis and 17.3% over the past 52 weeks. Despite the robust momentum, analysts are skeptical. Among the 21 analysts covering the PLTR stock, the consensus rating is a “Hold.” On the bright side, it currently trades above its mean price target of $157.72.

That’s a take on the old expression, “buy the rumor, sell the news.” Does that mean the opportunity and the profit-making opportunities are done? Not at all. The soap opera will just be starting. While the Fed’s next move is baked in the cake, it is far from settled as to what will come next, other than a ton of back-and-forth chatter on financial television. Not to mention on social media. But that’s to be expected. I’m focused instead on what has been setting up technically in anticipation of this market-moving news from Jerome Powell and company. There’s never a guarantee of a follow-through upside move, of course. But all we can do at times like this is play the percentages. So, here are 3 tickers I see as follows: They have daily chart patterns that imply that there’s buying strength behind them. Their Barchart Opinion scores are such that they are less likely to break down hard without a fight. The Fed lowering rates potentially positions them to go from “setup conditions” to “buying conditions,” once the market’s first 24 hours post-Fed news conference has passed. In my experience, there’s a lot more volatility from mid-day Wednesday through mid-day Thursday, when the shock value of the day’s events are starting to fade. One big assumption I’m making is that when the rate cut is announced, the stock market will do what it has conditioned itself to do: act like the Fed controls longer-term interest rates, when in fact it does not. The Fed sets overnight lending rates, more likely to impact your T-bill holdings, CDs, and market accounts than a 10-year bond. However, someone forgot to tell that to the algorithms! You know, the ones that have much greater sway over what happens to our stock market wealth than corporate earnings, or even what the Fed does. This week is all about the market’s reaction, which is what occurs based on its interpretation. That is aided heavily by Wall Street analysts and macro pundits. In other words… Let’s Go to the Charts, Since They Tend to Tell the Story Best! The 10-year bond rate is ever so close to breaking down. That is, rates dropping below 4% meaningfully, for the first time in more than 2 years. I’ve tracked this here for you before, and those very thin lines forming a trend channel in the top section of the chart are reaching decision time. Just like the Fed. The reaction of stocks in the aggregate will have a lot to do with how the 10-year yield behaves. That’s the rate that mortgages and many other big-money loans are based on. So there’s a trickle-down effect to consumer behavior and buying power, as well as the ability for corporations to borrow at favorable rates to keep growing revenue and earnings. Stock to Watch #1: Caterpillar Caterpillar (CAT) thrives on spending by big industry, and it provides its own financing to customers who need it. If those rates dip, it is poised to see its lending division get busier, as business increases. The chart shows a stock meandering the past couple of months after a mighty move. It is so close to breaking out. Ah, but the Fed’s decision might be the tipping point. Stock to Watch #2: JPMorgan Chase JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is a giant bank with a giant brokerage and investing business. So we don’t need CEO Jamie Dimon to tell us that lower rates should help this sector, and the bigger stocks within it. That said, the one way that this logic can go awry is if the bond market rejects the drop in rates, and pressures the 10-year yield higher. If big bond holders view the combination of Fed easing and the continuation of government reluctance to cut spending negatively, that could mess this all up. But for now, the chart points higher, and seems to be anticipating good news from the Fed. That’s a breakout right there. If it can keep it. Stock to Watch #3: Microsoft Microsoft (MSFT)? What’s Microsoft doing in this trio? How is this multitrillion-dollar stock impacted by what the Fed does? Answer: It isn’t. MSFT has a AAA credit rating, which is higher than that of the U.S. government. So “Mr. Softee” can finance itself. But if the Fed loosens monetary policy, the stout MSFT could benefit from its customers’ increased ability and willingness to buy its products and services. The stock rallied on earnings last time around, reached the $560 area, and promptly fell back 10%. Re-rallying on a Fed move is not far-fetched here. Popcorn, Powell and Pundits: Here We Go OK, it’s not exactly the Emmys or even the Tony awards. But Fed announcements and the post-meeting Q&A are now must-see TV for traders, at least so they can measure for themselves to what degree those events will impact their portfolios, and for how long. It didn’t used to be this way. Fed day used to be just any other day. But that was way back before phones in our pockets, and computer screens that did more than allow us to type and maybe add some numbers. For some it’s the same game they’ve always known, while for others, it’s a completely new world. And we’re using our experience to try to profit from it, at every turn.

Many also learn (the hard way) that “RSI overbought” is not an automatic sell. In strong trends, RSI can stay overbought for weeks while price keeps marching higher. That’s where the Average Directional Index (ADX) — Welles Wilder’s trend-strength indicator — can save you from getting shaken out too early. More News from Barchart - Should You Buy the Dip as Palantir Stock Falls for 7 Straight Days? - George Soros Is Betting Big on Beaten-Down UnitedHealth Stock. Should You? - 2 ‘Strong Buy’ Stocks Offering Fat Yields of Over 7.5% in August 2025 In a recent live webinar, John Rowland, CMT walked through a clean approach on Microsoft (MSFT): reference RSI for momentum conditions, and use ADX for trend strength/confirmation. Below is the distilled playbook so you can put it to work, along with links to the short explainer clip and the full webinar for deeper training. What RSI Really Says (and What It Doesn’t) - RSI > 70 = overbought condition, not an automatic sell. - RSI < 30 = oversold condition, not an automatic buy. An actionable RSI signal is often the indicator’s exit from those zones (e.g., RSI falls out of >70). But that signal can be weak when viewed in isolation, especially during powerful trends. What ADX Tells You ADX measures trend strength, not direction. A rising ADX indicates a strengthening trend, while a falling or flattening ADX suggests that momentum is wearing thin. Common guideposts for using ADX include: - < 20: weak/choppy trend - 20–25: building/borderline - > 25: trending Optionally, use Wilder’s companion lines, +DI / –DI, for directional bias. Why Combine RSI + ADX? Because context turns a “maybe” into a plan: - If RSI exits overbought territory but ADX is still rising, the uptrend is still strengthening – which means that RSI dip may be noise (an early/false sell signal). - If RSI exits overbought and ADX rolls over (stops rising and turns down), that’s a stronger warning of trend fatigue – meaning it’s time to manage risk, take partial profits, and tighten stops. - Bearish divergence adds conviction: this is when price makes higher highs while RSI makes lower highs — and if ADX also stalls after rising, odds of a pullback increase. John’s MSFT Example Check out the MSFT example in John’s webinar to see this play out on the charts: - Setup: MSFT in a strong uptrend; ADX elevated (trend strong) but beginning to flatten. - RSI falls out of overbought — alone, that would look like a sell. - Cross-check: ADX is still strengthening → not a high-quality RSI sell signal. - Higher-quality signal: wait for ADX to turn down while RSI falls, or spot bearish divergence on RSI as price grinds higher. - Tactical takeaway: In strong trends, consider risk management (scale out/raise stops) rather than flipping short on the first RSI exit."

Investors also digested a flood of earnings highlighted by Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) in after-hours. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell about 0.4%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) trimmed earlier losses to close down 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.2%. The Fed kept rates unchanged on Wednesday, though it was not a unanimous decision. Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman voted against the decision, preferring the Fed cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point. During Wednesday's press conference Powell noted it is still the ""early days"" of any potential tariff impacts on economic data and said ""no decisions"" had been made yet about a September rate cut. He didn't explicitly say the Fed's next monetary policy move will be a reduction. The Fed — and markets — received key signals on the US economy's health early Wednesday. US GDP grew at a 3% annual rate in the second quarter, rebounding from its first pullback in three years in Q1. Meanwhile, US private employers added more jobs than expected in July, with private payrolls also returning to growth after a surprise pullback in June. The rosier economic data prompted Trump to again call on the Fed to lower rates. ""'Too Late' must now lower the rate,"" he wrote on social media hours before the central bank was set to release its policy statement.

LIVE COVERAGE IS OVER 29 updates- Grace O'Donnell Robinhood earnings top expectations, boosted by heightened trading activity Robinhood (HOOD) stock wavered after hours after the financial platform reported strong results. Market volatility and the return of meme stocks fueled investor activity on the platform. Options contracts traded on Robinhood increased 32% year over year to a record 515 million, the company said. Robinhood also attributed strong results to new product launches, including tokenized stocks. For the quarter, Robinhood's net revenue was $989 million, versus the Street's estimate of $921.5 million, per Bloomberg consensus data. Earnings per share came in at $0.42, higher than the $0.34 per share estimated. Robinhood stock has been on a tear this year — up 185% year to date — largely driven by crypto and AI hype.

Analysts expected EPS to hit $5.89 on revenue of $44.3 billion. Meta stock rose as much as 10% following the results. The company also said it expects revenue in its third quarter will be between $47.5 billion and $50 billion; the Street was looking for $46.5 billion. Meta also narrowed its spending forecast to a band of $114 billion-$118 billion, with capex expected to come in between $66 billion and $72 billion. ""While the infrastructure planning process remains highly dynamic, we currently expect another year of similarly significant capital expenditures dollar growth in 2026 as we continue aggressively pursuing opportunities to bring additional capacity online to meet the needs of our artificial intelligence efforts and business operations,"" CFO Susan Li said in a statement.

Investors awaited earnings from Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) after the session closed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell about 0.4%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) slipped 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose almost 2%. The Federal Reserve decided to keep rates steady at the end of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday afternoon. Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated it was too early to determine the impacts of potential tariffs on the economy. Investors await earnings from Microsoft and Meta after the close and commentary on the AI trade, which has sent the markets to all-time highs in recent weeks. - Allie Canal Powell on Trump visit: 'It was an honor to host him' President Trump made an unusual visit to the Federal Reserve last week, donning a hard hat for a tour of its $2.5 billion renovation project led by Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The visit came amid growing criticism from the Trump administration over the project’s cost and timeline as the president continues to push for lower interest rates. ""It was an honor to host him,"" Powell said on Wednesday. ""It’s not something that happens very often. ... But it was a good visit."" The two briefly sparred over the project's price tag after Trump claimed it had risen to $3.1 billion. Powell corrected him in real time, saying, ""You just added in a third building. ... It’s not new."" As Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reported, Trump aides have accused the Fed of underplaying the full cost, insisting all three buildings should count. Deputy chief of staff James Blair later accused Powell of ""splitting hairs."" Ultimately, Powell said he was ""quite pleased"" to hear the president repeatedly emphasize that his priority was seeing the construction completed as soon as possible. ""That is our focus, and that’s what we’re going to do,"" Powell said. - Allie Canal Powell on trade deals: 'It doesn't feel like we're very close to the end' Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that trade negotiations have gained some clarity with the effective US tariff rate now estimated to settle around 15%, according to Wall Street economists. However, he warned there's still considerable uncertainty over when and how these tariffs will ultimately affect the economy. ""It's been a very dynamic time for these trade negotiations and lots and lots of events in the intervening period,"" Powell said in his post-decision press conference. ""But we're still a ways away from seeing where things settle down."" Powell added that while the Fed is continuing to learn more, ""many uncertainties"" remain, and it ""doesn't feel like we're very close to the end of that process."" - Josh Schafer Powell: 'We have made no decisions about September' Markets are pricing in a 63% chance the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates at its next meeting in September. President Trump insinuated a similar expectation earlier this afternoon, saying that the Fed ""probably won't"" cut rates until September. But when asked directly about cutting rates then, Powell didn't guarantee anything. ""We have made no decisions about September,"" Powell said. ""We don't we don't do that in advance."" Powell noted that there will be two rounds of inflation and labor market reports ahead of the next meeting that will help guide that decision. - Josh Schafer One chart helps explain the case for cutting interest rates The Fed held interest rates steady on Wednesday but the decision wasn't unanimous. Fed Govenors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman dissented. In a speech on July 17 titled the ""case for cutting now,"" Waller pointed out that the tariff inflation boost will be ""temporary."" ""Standard central banking practice is to 'look through' such price-level effects as long as inflation expectations are anchored, which they are."" Goldman Sachs Chief US economist David Mericle provided a chart in the Yahoo Finance Chartbook that visualizes this point. Mericle and the team at Goldman Sachs expect core PCE inflation to peak at 3.3% around June 2026 before collapsing to 2.7% by the end of the year and continuing its path lower. To Mericle, whose team holds a call for the Fed to cut rates by a quarter percentage point at its final three meetings of the year, the key part of this chart is that inflation eventually returns to its trend downward once the tariff pass through is finished. ""We agree with Governor Waller that tariffs will have only a one-time effect on the price level and are unlikely to dislodge inflation expectations and ignite a prolonged period of high inflation,"" Mericle wrote in a research note on July 27. But, Mericle added, the one-time tariff boost sending inflation back above 3% ""could leave some Fed officials hesitant to cut."" - Josh Schafer Fed leaves interest rates unchanged as Bowman and Waller dissent In a widely anticipated move, the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady in a range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The decision was not unanimous, with Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman voting against the decision. Those officials preferred the Fed to lower the federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point. - Josh Schafer Stocks steady into Fed decision Stocks are modestly higher on Wednesday as investors await the Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision and a subsequent press conference from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) nudged up 0.1%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) ticked up 0.5%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield was up about 3 basis points to hover near 4.36%. - Josh Schafer The 'economic mirage' in the Q2 GDP rebound US economic growth rebounded in the second quarter after contracting for the first time in three years to start 2025. The headline number, a 3% annualized pace of growth, was well above the 2.6% increase economists had expected, a sharp mover higher from the 0.5% contraction seen in the first quarter. But the BEA noted that the second quarter bounce-back reflected a decrease in imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP. EY chief economist Gregory Daco noted that the quarterly swings in imports created an ""economic mirage"" that masked some underlying cooling in the economy. Daco argues that when ""stripping out the noise"" and looking at a metric like growth in sales to private domestic purchasers, the data points to a slowing in economic activity. Sales to private domestic purchasers rose 1.2% in the second quarter, lower than the 1.9% growth seen in the first quarter and the slowest pace of growth since 2022. ""Policy uncertainty, resurgent inflation pressures stemming from tariffs, and tighter immigration constraints are beginning to weigh more visibly on activity,"" Daco said. - Laura Bratton Wall Street bullish on Reddit ahead of Q2 earnings Reddit (RDDT) stock rose more than 2% Wednesday as Wall Street analysts largely maintained their bullish takes on shares ahead of the company's second quarter earnings. Analysts at Needham, Deutsche Bank, Jefferies, and Raymond James reiterated their Buy ratings on the stock in notes to clients heading into the social media platform's quarterly results Thursday after the bell. ""The bear case (that Google Search will no longer send traffic to RDDT) is not playing out,"" wrote Needham analyst Laura Martin. Concerns over the impact of changes to Google Search's algorithm on Reddit's daily active users drove the stock down in the aftermath of its past two quarterly reports. Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni said web traffic data showed daily active user growth stabilizing in the past three months after decelerating throughout the first quarter. Needham's Martin added: ""AI-driven ad tools, such as Reddit Insights & Conversation Summaries, suggest RDDT is already monetizing GenAI."" - Laura Bratton Mortgage rates near 7% Home contract signings slumped more than expected in June, the latest sign that the housing market is still essentially frozen, Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports. Boston writes: - Laura Bratton Hershey stock climbs after Q2 earnings beat as investors look past tariff, cocoa shortage impacts Hershey (HSY) shares rose Wednesday morning after the candy and snack maker reported second quarter earnings and revenue ahead of Wall Street's expectations. Its earnings per share of $1.21 were above the $1.01 projected, while revenue of $2.6 billion was above the $2.5 billion estimate, according to Bloomberg consensus data. Revenue was boosted by a later Easter in 2025. The stock's climb comes despite the company revising its full-year outlook. It now sees earnings per share falling 50% in 2025 versus the prior 40% decline expected. That drop comes as Hershey faces record-high cocoa prices (CC=F) due to a global shortage and anticipates as much as a $180 million hit during the fiscal year from tariffs. The company recently raised candy prices due to elevated cocoa costs. - Laura Bratton Trump says Powell must lower interest rates 'now' following GDP uptick President Trump used a return to GDP growth ahead of a widely expected Federal Reserve decision to keep monetary policy unchanged to say that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell must “now” lower rates, Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports. Werschkul writes: - Laura Bratton Marvell Technology soars 10% as Morgan Stanley analyst lifts price outlook Marvell Technology (MRVL) shares spiked Wednesday after Morgan Stanley (MS) analyst Joseph Moore lifted his price target on the stock to $80 from $73. In a note to clients on Tuesday, Moore cited the chipmaker's opportunity in the AI networking space. Networking products such as data center switches, ethernet controllers, and digital signal processors are required in data centers to receive and send data between AI chips and servers. Marvell makes both networking products and custom AI chips (also known as processors) called ASIC accelerators. ""For both Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell (MRVL), we expect AI upside this year to come from the networking side rather than processors [custom AI chips],"" Moore wrote. Moore said Marvell ""should be a direct beneficiary of NVIDIA's upcoming product cycle."" That's because networking technology is needed to support upcoming purchases of Nvidia's latest Blackwell chips and servers. ""Marvell is firmly in the AI winners camp,"" wrote Moore. - Laura Bratton Nvidia leads muted Mag 7 ahead of Microsoft, Meta earnings Nvidia (NVDA) shares moved up 1% early on Wednesday, leading the group of ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks ahead of earnings reports from Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) after the bell. Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA), and Microsoft stock prices wavered around the flat line, while Meta and Google (GOOG) shares rose less than 1%. Apple (AAPL) slipped around 0.1% in lackluster trade for US stocks more broadly. Nvidia is up roughly 4% over the past five trading sessions, compared with the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite's (^IXIC) 0.6% gain over the same period. - Laura Bratton Stocks steady at the open US stocks held steady at the start of Wednesday's trading session ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest-rate decision and earnings from Big Tech names Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META). The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) wavered along the flat line, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) nudged nearly 0.1% higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) ticked up roughly 0.2%. The indices had fallen on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 ending its six-day record streak. - Myles Udland Jobs data, GDP both top forecasts in a strong morning for the US economy Data from ADP on private payroll growth and the first look at second quarter GDP growth out Wednesday morning both topped forecasts, a sign of continued resilience in the US economy. Private payroll growth in July tallied 104,000 according to the latest data from ADP, more than the 77,000 jobs that private employers were expected to add and a rebound from the 23,000 jobs that were cut in the sector last month. ""Our hiring and pay data are broadly indicative of a healthy economy,"" said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP. ""Employers have grown more optimistic that consumers, the backbone of the economy, will remain resilient."" Fifteen minutes after ADP's data was released, the BEA put out its first look at GDP growth in the second quarter, which showed the US economy grew at an annualized rate of 3% in the second quarter, faster than the 2.6% that had been expected by economists. In the first three months of the year, the US economy contracted at a rate of 0.5%. The BEA noted in its release the rebound in the second quarter was largely a result of decreased imports, which had weighed on growth in the first quarter as businesses increased orders ahead of expected tariffs. In response to the data, longer-term Treasury yields ticked slightly higher while futures remained little-changed ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy announcement set for 2:00 p.m. ET. In a post on Truth Social following the GDP data, President Trump again called on the Fed to cut rates. The central bank is widely expected to make no change to its interest rate policy later today. - Grace O'Donnell Premarket trending tickers: Novo Nordisk stock falls, Starbucks stock pops Here's a look at some of the top stocks trending in premarket trading: Novo Nordisk (NVO): The stock continued to sink on Wednesday, falling 4% premarket after a 21% wipeout on Tuesday. The drugmaker cut its full-year sales and operating profit guidance again, related to lower growth expectations for its diabetes and weight-loss drugs, Wegovy and Ozempic. Eli Lilly stock also fell Tuesday but was up 1% Wednesday morning. Starbucks (SBUX): Shares of the coffee giant popped 5% premarket after the company reported its sixth straight quarterly sales decline. But things weren't as bad as investors feared, and CEO Brian Niccol assured Wall Street that the company was ""ahead of schedule"" in its turnaround plan. V.F. Corp (VFC): The Vans parent's stock soared nearly 20% after the company beat first quarter revenue estimates on Wednesday, aided by an uptick in demand for its apparel and footwear products. Palo Alto Networks (PANW): The software company is in final talks to acquire Israeli cybersecurity provider CyberArk, the Wall Street Journal reported, and the deal could be finalized as early as this week. The deal could place a value north of $20 billion on CyberArk, potentially making it one of the largest tech takeovers this year. Shares of Palo Alto Networks rose 0.4% in premarket trading. Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) stocks rose modestly ahead of their quarterly results, which are set to be released after the closing bell on Wednesday. Investors will be looking to the two Big Tech companies for signs of AI sales growth and monetization. - Grace O'Donnell A divided Fed is expected to hold rates steady, defying Trump's calls for a cut The Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold interest rates steady on Wednesday, though the central bank remains internally divided over the path of monetary policy amid the Trump administration's pressure on the Fed.

Investors also digested a flood of earnings highlighted by Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) in after-hours. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell about 0.4%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) trimmed earlier losses to close down 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.2%. The Fed kept rates unchanged on Wednesday, though it was not a unanimous decision. Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman voted against the decision, preferring the Fed cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point. During Wednesday's press conference Powell noted it is still the ""early days"" of any potential tariff impacts on economic data and said ""no decisions"" had been made yet about a September rate cut. He didn't explicitly say the Fed's next monetary policy move will be a reduction. The Fed — and markets — received key signals on the US economy's health early Wednesday. US GDP grew at a 3% annual rate in the second quarter, rebounding from its first pullback in three years in Q1. Meanwhile, US private employers added more jobs than expected in July, with private payrolls also returning to growth after a surprise pullback in June. The rosier economic data prompted Trump to again call on the Fed to lower rates. ""'Too Late' must now lower the rate,"" he wrote on social media hours before the central bank was set to release its policy statement.

LIVE COVERAGE IS OVER 29 updates- Grace O'Donnell Robinhood earnings top expectations, boosted by heightened trading activity Robinhood (HOOD) stock wavered after hours after the financial platform reported strong results. Market volatility and the return of meme stocks fueled investor activity on the platform. Options contracts traded on Robinhood increased 32% year over year to a record 515 million, the company said. Robinhood also attributed strong results to new product launches, including tokenized stocks. For the quarter, Robinhood's net revenue was $989 million, versus the Street's estimate of $921.5 million, per Bloomberg consensus data. Earnings per share came in at $0.42, higher than the $0.34 per share estimated. Robinhood stock has been on a tear this year — up 185% year to date — largely driven by crypto and AI hype.

Analysts expected EPS to hit $5.89 on revenue of $44.3 billion. Meta stock rose as much as 10% following the results. The company also said it expects revenue in its third quarter will be between $47.5 billion and $50 billion; the Street was looking for $46.5 billion. Meta also narrowed its spending forecast to a band of $114 billion-$118 billion, with capex expected to come in between $66 billion and $72 billion. ""While the infrastructure planning process remains highly dynamic, we currently expect another year of similarly significant capital expenditures dollar growth in 2026 as we continue aggressively pursuing opportunities to bring additional capacity online to meet the needs of our artificial intelligence efforts and business operations,"" CFO Susan Li said in a statement. Other notable metrics for Meta included average price per ad, which rose 9% over last year, and ad impressions, which rose 11%. Headcount rose 7% from the prior year in the second quarter. - Grace O'Donnell Microsoft posts Q4 beat on top and bottom line on cloud, AI strength Microsoft (MSFT) stock climbed 6% after hours after the tech giant posted strong earnings and cloud strength. Here's what Microsoft reported compared to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg: Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports that Intelligent Cloud segment revenue, which includes Microsoft’s Azure business, topped out at $29.8 billion. Analysts were looking for $29.09 billion. - Ines Ferré Stocks mixed as Fed signals not ready to cut rates, Microsoft, Meta earnings loom US stocks ended the session mixed on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady. Investors awaited earnings from Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) after the session closed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell about 0.4%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) slipped 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose almost 2%. The Federal Reserve decided to keep rates steady at the end of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday afternoon. Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated it was too early to determine the impacts of potential tariffs on the economy. Investors await earnings from Microsoft and Meta after the close and commentary on the AI trade, which has sent the markets to all-time highs in recent weeks. - Allie Canal Powell on Trump visit: 'It was an honor to host him' President Trump made an unusual visit to the Federal Reserve last week, donning a hard hat for a tour of its $2.5 billion renovation project led by Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The visit came amid growing criticism from the Trump administration over the project’s cost and timeline as the president continues to push for lower interest rates. ""It was an honor to host him,"" Powell said on Wednesday. ""It’s not something that happens very often. ... But it was a good visit."" The two briefly sparred over the project's price tag after Trump claimed it had risen to $3.1 billion. Powell corrected him in real time, saying, ""You just added in a third building. ... It’s not new."" As Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reported, Trump aides have accused the Fed of underplaying the full cost, insisting all three buildings should count. Deputy chief of staff James Blair later accused Powell of ""splitting hairs."" Ultimately, Powell said he was ""quite pleased"" to hear the president repeatedly emphasize that his priority was seeing the construction completed as soon as possible. ""That is our focus, and that’s what we’re going to do,"" Powell said. - Allie Canal Powell on trade deals: 'It doesn't feel like we're very close to the end' Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that trade negotiations have gained some clarity with the effective US tariff rate now estimated to settle around 15%, according to Wall Street economists. However, he warned there's still considerable uncertainty over when and how these tariffs will ultimately affect the economy. ""It's been a very dynamic time for these trade negotiations and lots and lots of events in the intervening period,"" Powell said in his post-decision press conference. ""But we're still a ways away from seeing where things settle down."" Powell added that while the Fed is continuing to learn more, ""many uncertainties"" remain, and it ""doesn't feel like we're very close to the end of that process."" - Josh Schafer Powell: 'We have made no decisions about September' Markets are pricing in a 63% chance the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates at its next meeting in September. President Trump insinuated a similar expectation earlier this afternoon, saying that the Fed ""probably won't"" cut rates until September. But when asked directly about cutting rates then, Powell didn't guarantee anything. ""We have made no decisions about September,"" Powell said. ""We don't we don't do that in advance."" Powell noted that there will be two rounds of inflation and labor market reports ahead of the next meeting that will help guide that decision. - Josh Schafer One chart helps explain the case for cutting interest rates The Fed held interest rates steady on Wednesday but the decision wasn't unanimous. Fed Govenors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman dissented. In a speech on July 17 titled the ""case for cutting now,"" Waller pointed out that the tariff inflation boost will be ""temporary."" ""Standard central banking practice is to 'look through' such price-level effects as long as inflation expectations are anchored, which they are."" Goldman Sachs Chief US economist David Mericle provided a chart in the Yahoo Finance Chartbook that visualizes this point. Mericle and the team at Goldman Sachs expect core PCE inflation to peak at 3.3% around June 2026 before collapsing to 2.7% by the end of the year and continuing its path lower. To Mericle, whose team holds a call for the Fed to cut rates by a quarter percentage point at its final three meetings of the year, the key part of this chart is that inflation eventually returns to its trend downward once the tariff pass through is finished. ""We agree with Governor Waller that tariffs will have only a one-time effect on the price level and are unlikely to dislodge inflation expectations and ignite a prolonged period of high inflation,"" Mericle wrote in a research note on July 27. But, Mericle added, the one-time tariff boost sending inflation back above 3% ""could leave some Fed officials hesitant to cut."" - Josh Schafer Fed leaves interest rates unchanged as Bowman and Waller dissent In a widely anticipated move, the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady in a range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The decision was not unanimous, with Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman voting against the decision. Those officials preferred the Fed to lower the federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point. - Josh Schafer Stocks steady into Fed decision Stocks are modestly higher on Wednesday as investors await the Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision and a subsequent press conference from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) nudged up 0.1%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) ticked up 0.5%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield was up about 3 basis points to hover near 4.36%. - Josh Schafer The 'economic mirage' in the Q2 GDP rebound US economic growth rebounded in the second quarter after contracting for the first time in three years to start 2025. The headline number, a 3% annualized pace of growth, was well above the 2.6% increase economists had expected, a sharp mover higher from the 0.5% contraction seen in the first quarter. But the BEA noted that the second quarter bounce-back reflected a decrease in imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP. EY chief economist Gregory Daco noted that the quarterly swings in imports created an ""economic mirage"" that masked some underlying cooling in the economy. Daco argues that when ""stripping out the noise"" and looking at a metric like growth in sales to private domestic purchasers, the data points to a slowing in economic activity. Sales to private domestic purchasers rose 1.2% in the second quarter, lower than the 1.9% growth seen in the first quarter and the slowest pace of growth since 2022. ""Policy uncertainty, resurgent inflation pressures stemming from tariffs, and tighter immigration constraints are beginning to weigh more visibly on activity,"" Daco said. - Laura Bratton Wall Street bullish on Reddit ahead of Q2 earnings Reddit (RDDT) stock rose more than 2% Wednesday as Wall Street analysts largely maintained their bullish takes on shares ahead of the company's second quarter earnings. Analysts at Needham, Deutsche Bank, Jefferies, and Raymond James reiterated their Buy ratings on the stock in notes to clients heading into the social media platform's quarterly results Thursday after the bell. ""The bear case (that Google Search will no longer send traffic to RDDT) is not playing out,"" wrote Needham analyst Laura Martin. Concerns over the impact of changes to Google Search's algorithm on Reddit's daily active users drove the stock down in the aftermath of its past two quarterly reports. Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni said web traffic data showed daily active user growth stabilizing in the past three months after decelerating throughout the first quarter. Needham's Martin added: ""AI-driven ad tools, such as Reddit Insights & Conversation Summaries, suggest RDDT is already monetizing GenAI."" - Laura Bratton Mortgage rates near 7% Home contract signings slumped more than expected in June, the latest sign that the housing market is still essentially frozen, Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports. Boston writes: - Laura Bratton Hershey stock climbs after Q2 earnings beat as investors look past tariff, cocoa shortage impacts Hershey (HSY) shares rose Wednesday morning after the candy and snack maker reported second quarter earnings and revenue ahead of Wall Street's expectations. Its earnings per share of $1.21 were above the $1.01 projected, while revenue of $2.6 billion was above the $2.5 billion estimate, according to Bloomberg consensus data. Revenue was boosted by a later Easter in 2025. The stock's climb comes despite the company revising its full-year outlook. It now sees earnings per share falling 50% in 2025 versus the prior 40% decline expected. That drop comes as Hershey faces record-high cocoa prices (CC=F) due to a global shortage and anticipates as much as a $180 million hit during the fiscal year from tariffs. The company recently raised candy prices due to elevated cocoa costs. - Laura Bratton Trump says Powell must lower interest rates 'now' following GDP uptick President Trump used a return to GDP growth ahead of a widely expected Federal Reserve decision to keep monetary policy unchanged to say that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell must “now” lower rates, Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports. Werschkul writes: - Laura Bratton Marvell Technology soars 10% as Morgan Stanley analyst lifts price outlook Marvell Technology (MRVL) shares spiked Wednesday after Morgan Stanley (MS) analyst Joseph Moore lifted his price target on the stock to $80 from $73. In a note to clients on Tuesday, Moore cited the chipmaker's opportunity in the AI networking space. Networking products such as data center switches, ethernet controllers, and digital signal processors are required in data centers to receive and send data between AI chips and servers. Marvell makes both networking products and custom AI chips (also known as processors) called ASIC accelerators. ""For both Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell (MRVL), we expect AI upside this year to come from the networking side rather than processors [custom AI chips],"" Moore wrote. Moore said Marvell ""should be a direct beneficiary of NVIDIA's upcoming product cycle."" That's because networking technology is needed to support upcoming purchases of Nvidia's latest Blackwell chips and servers. ""Marvell is firmly in the AI winners camp,"" wrote Moore. - Laura Bratton Nvidia leads muted Mag 7 ahead of Microsoft, Meta earnings Nvidia (NVDA) shares moved up 1% early on Wednesday, leading the group of ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks ahead of earnings reports from Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) after the bell. Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA), and Microsoft stock prices wavered around the flat line, while Meta and Google (GOOG) shares rose less than 1%. Apple (AAPL) slipped around 0.1% in lackluster trade for US stocks more broadly. Nvidia is up roughly 4% over the past five trading sessions, compared with the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite's (^IXIC) 0.6% gain over the same period. - Laura Bratton Stocks steady at the open US stocks held steady at the start of Wednesday's trading session ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest-rate decision and earnings from Big Tech names Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META). The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) wavered along the flat line, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) nudged nearly 0.1% higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) ticked up roughly 0.2%. The indices had fallen on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 ending its six-day record streak. - Myles Udland Jobs data, GDP both top forecasts in a strong morning for the US economy Data from ADP on private payroll growth and the first look at second quarter GDP growth out Wednesday morning both topped forecasts, a sign of continued resilience in the US economy. Private payroll growth in July tallied 104,000 according to the latest data from ADP, more than the 77,000 jobs that private employers were expected to add and a rebound from the 23,000 jobs that were cut in the sector last month. ""Our hiring and pay data are broadly indicative of a healthy economy,"" said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP. ""Employers have grown more optimistic that consumers, the backbone of the economy, will remain resilient."" Fifteen minutes after ADP's data was released, the BEA put out its first look at GDP growth in the second quarter, which showed the US economy grew at an annualized rate of 3% in the second quarter, faster than the 2.6% that had been expected by economists. In the first three months of the year, the US economy contracted at a rate of 0.5%. The BEA noted in its release the rebound in the second quarter was largely a result of decreased imports, which had weighed on growth in the first quarter as businesses increased orders ahead of expected tariffs. In response to the data, longer-term Treasury yields ticked slightly higher while futures remained little-changed ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy announcement set for 2:00 p.m. ET. In a post on Truth Social following the GDP data, President Trump again called on the Fed to cut rates. The central bank is widely expected to make no change to its interest rate policy later today. - Grace O'Donnell Premarket trending tickers: Novo Nordisk stock falls, Starbucks stock pops Here's a look at some of the top stocks trending in premarket trading: Novo Nordisk (NVO): The stock continued to sink on Wednesday, falling 4% premarket after a 21% wipeout on Tuesday.

Eli Lilly stock also fell Tuesday but was up 1% Wednesday morning. Starbucks (SBUX): Shares of the coffee giant popped 5% premarket after the company reported its sixth straight quarterly sales decline.

Palo Alto Networks (PANW): The software company is in final talks to acquire Israeli cybersecurity provider CyberArk, the Wall Street Journal reported, and the deal could be finalized as early as this week. The deal could place a value north of $20 billion on CyberArk, potentially making it one of the largest tech takeovers this year. Shares of Palo Alto Networks rose 0.4% in premarket trading. Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) stocks rose modestly ahead of their quarterly results, which are set to be released after the closing bell on Wednesday. Investors will be looking to the two Big Tech companies for signs of AI sales growth and monetization. - Grace O'Donnell A divided Fed is expected to hold rates steady, defying Trump's calls for a cut The Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold interest rates steady on Wednesday, though the central bank remains internally divided over the path of monetary policy amid the Trump administration's pressure on the Fed.

(GOOGL) is a technology conglomerate that oversees a portfolio that spans search, advertising, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, autonomous driving, life sciences, and more. Valued at a market cap of $3 trillion, the company is expected to announce its fiscal Q3 earnings for 2025 after the market closes on Wednesday, Oct. 29. Before this event, analysts expect Google's parent company to report a profit of $2.29 per share, up 8% from $2.12 per share in the prior-ago quarter. The company has a promising trajectory of consistently beating Wall Street’s bottom-line estimates in each of the last four quarters. Its earnings of $2.31 per share in the previous quarter outpaced the consensus estimates by 7.4%. More News from Barchart For fiscal 2025, analysts expect Alphabet to report a profit of $9.95 per share, representing a 23.8% increase from $8.04 per share in fiscal 2024. Furthermore, its EPS is expected to grow 6.9% year-over-year to $10.64 in fiscal 2026. Alphabet has surged 54.3% over the past 52 weeks, significantly outpacing both the S&P 500 Index's ($SPX) 14.5% return and the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLC) 27.1% rise over the same time frame. On Jul. 23, Alphabet reported impressive Q2 earnings results, sending its shares up 1% in the following trading session. The company’s quarterly revenue improved 13.8% year-over-year to $96.4 billion, surpassing consensus estimates by 18%. Moreover, its EPS of $2.31 rose 22.2% from the year-ago quarter and came in 7.4% ahead of analyst estimates. AI positively impacted every part of Alphabet’s business, driving strong momentum. Wall Street analysts are highly optimistic about Alphabet’s stock, with an overall ""Strong Buy"" rating. Among 56 analysts covering the stock, 42 recommend ""Strong Buy,"" five indicate ""Moderate Buy,” and nine suggest ""Hold.” While the company is trading above its mean price target of $252.04, its Street-high price target of $300 suggests a 17.1% potential upside from the current levels.

Unlike some billionaires, he didn't inherit his fortune. Instead, Ackman made his money by being one of the most successful investors around. His Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund has over $19 billion in assets under management. As of June 30, 2025, Pershing Square's portfolio owned only 11 stocks. Ackman had $1.3 billion invested in one artificial intelligence (AI) stock that Wall Street thinks investors should buy hand over fist. Ackman's AI addition Pershing Square already owned three AI stocks before the second quarter of 2025. Uber Technologies (UBER -0.25%) remains the biggest holding, making up a little over 20% of the portfolio. The hedge fund also owns both share classes of Google parent Alphabet (GOOG 0.86%) (GOOGL 0.82%). Ackman added another AI stock to the list in Q2. He initiated a new stake in Amazon (AMZN -0.61%), buying around 5.82 million shares. This position was valued at roughly $1.3 billion at the end of the quarter. Why did Ackman load up on Amazon? It's a company his team has ""long studied and admired,"" according to Pershing Square's latest interim report. Amazon's AI opportunities played a significant role in the billionaire's decision to buy the stock after a lengthy period of watching from the sidelines. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is well-positioned to benefit from the shift in IT spending to the cloud. AI is a major driver of this trend. Pershing Square's interim report stated, ""Over time, we expect AI to spur greater cloud adoption."" Ackman and his team believe that AI could ""potentially even accelerate"" revenue growth for AWS. A Wall Street favorite Wall Street really likes Amazon, too. S&P Global (SPGI 0.35%) surveyed 68 analysts in October who covered the stock. Fourteen of those analysts (20.5%) rated Amazon as a ""strong buy."" A whopping 51 analysts (75%) rated it as a ""buy."" That leaves only three outliers, all of whom recommended holding the stock. This overwhelming analyst support for Amazon shows up in another way. The consensus 12-month price target for the stock reflects an upside potential of 17%. The most bullish analyst thinks that Amazon's shares could soar roughly 35% over the next year. Analysts see the same things that Ackman does. They recognize the huge AI tailwind that exists for hyperscalers. They know that AWS holds the largest market share in cloud services. But AWS isn't the only way that Amazon is benefiting from AI. For example, the company recently deployed its one millionth robot. It also launched a new generative AI foundation model called DeepFleet that coordinates robots across its fulfillment network. This new AI platform should improve the travel time of Amazon's robots by 10% and help the company deliver packages to customers more quickly and cost-effectively. Are Ackman and analysts right about Amazon? Ackman loves Amazon. Analysts love Amazon. Are they right about the stock? I think so. AWS does have a tremendous growth opportunity, thanks in large part to surging AI adoption. I believe we have yet to see the most impressive advances in AI. The use of AI agents remains in its early innings but could take off in a major way over the next couple of years. Breakthroughs in artificial general intelligence (AGI) could be a real possibility this decade. Amazon's e-commerce business should also continue to deliver exceptional growth. As Pershing Square's interim report noted, e-commerce sales penetration in the U.S. has roughly doubled over the last 10 years. However, it still makes up less than 20% of total retail sales. Amazon's brand, fast delivery, low prices, and operational scale should enable the company to be the biggest beneficiary as e-commerce wins a larger percentage of the total retail market. When a super-successful billionaire hedge fund manager and over 95% of Wall Street analysts are bullish about a stock, one would think that stock would be a good pick. In Amazon's case, I'd agree."

Speaking at Italian Tech Week, Bezos acknowledged the market is experiencing what he called an ""industrial bubble,"" where investors are funding both good and bad ideas indiscriminately. The comparison to the dot-com crash worries many investors, but Bezos sees a crucial difference. Industrial bubbles, he argued, often produce lasting benefits for society even when individual companies fail. He pointed to the biotech boom of the 1990s, which led to the development of life-saving drugs despite incurring billions in losses and numerous bankruptcies. Bezos emphasized that the bubble doesn't invalidate AI's transformative potential. The technology is real and will impact every industry, he said, improving quality and productivity across companies worldwide. His own Amazon continues to bet big on AI, constructing data centers and developing custom chips to meet surging demand. Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon echoed similar concerns about market froth while acknowledging AI's powerful enterprise potential. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman previously warned that smart people get overexcited during bubbles but maintained that the economic upside would be substantial. Nvidia Provides Both Safety and Opportunity For investors seeking safety amid the AI frenzy, Nvidia (NVDA) stands out among the Magnificent 7. Over the last three years, Nvidia's stock has increased by 1,400%. Despite these outsized gains, NVDA stock trades at a reasonable forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 32.5x, which is above the 10-year average of 36.7x. This relative valuation discount, combined with Nvidia's dominant position in AI infrastructure, suggests the company offers a more grounded entry point than other AI-related stocks trading at stratospheric valuations with minimal revenue to show for it. The Bull Case for NVDA Stock Nvidia continues to cement its position as the backbone of the AI revolution. It has recently announced several partnerships across various verticals, including quantum computing and robotics. The chipmaker unveiled breakthroughs across multiple fronts. In quantum computing, Nvidia's CUDA-X libraries are accelerating error correction and circuit optimization. A collaboration with QuEra achieved a 50x increase in decoding speed using AI models, while partnerships with Oxford Quantum Circuits delivered speedups of up to 600x in quantum compilation tasks. These advances address critical bottlenecks preventing quantum hardware from reaching practical applications. Nvidia also introduced the open-source Newton Physics Engine alongside Isaac GR00T N1.6, a new foundation model that brings humanlike reasoning to robots. The Newton engine, co-developed with Alphabet's (GOOG) (GOOGL) Google DeepMind and The Walt Disney Company's (DIS) Disney Research, enables developers to simulate complex robot actions, such as walking through snow or handling delicate objects. Leading robotics companies, including Boston Dynamics, Figure AI, and Agility Robotics, are adopting these technologies. A few days back, OpenAI and Nvidia announced a historic partnership to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems for OpenAI's next-generation infrastructure. Nvidia intends to invest up to $100 billion progressively as each gigawatt is deployed, with the first phase launching in late 2026 using the Vera Rubin platform. CEO Jensen Huang described it as the largest AI infrastructure project in history. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman emphasized the partnership's importance, noting that the AI platform serves over 700 million users weekly and requires computational resources to meet the growing demand for advanced AI capabilities. Finally, Nvidia announced a strategic collaboration with Intel to jointly develop x86 CPUs for data centers and custom PC chips integrating Nvidia GPUs. This partnership addresses roughly $50 billion in annual market opportunity across data centers and consumer PCs. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress reiterated the company's view that data center infrastructure requirements could reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by the end of the decade, underscoring the massive opportunity ahead as AI transforms every industry. What Is the Target Price for NVDA Stock? Nvidia is forecast to increase revenue from $130.5 billion in fiscal 2025 to $378 billion in fiscal 2030. Comparatively, adjusted earnings are forecast to expand from $2.99 per share to $9 per share in this period. If NVDA stock is priced at 30x forward earnings, it could gain around 90% within the next four years. Out of the 47 analysts covering NVDA stock, 40 recommend “Strong Buy,” two recommend “Moderate Buy,” four recommend “Hold,” and one recommends “Strong Sell.” The average NVDA stock price target is $217, above the current price of $188.

820cb307d113de1aab6b9fc48ffdcb04748aa2e547580ff2fc58823cd72f3de8,GOOGL,The 3 Best Growth Stocks to Buy in October,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-best-growth-stocks-buy-160002103.html,finance.yahoo.com,20250927T201500Z,semi,0.65,"Growth stocks are shares of companies that are expected to expand their revenues and earnings, outperforming their peers and the overall market. However, not all growth stocks have the ability to provide outsized gains in the long run. Here are a few standout names that are poised to deliver strong upside. The first growth stock on my list is Karman Holdings (KRMN), an aerospace and defense company. It designs, tests, manufactures, and sells “mission-critical systems” for use in missile defense, space launch, hypersonic technologies, and related programs. The company went public in February and has subsequently soared 204% from its $22 IPO price. Karman Holdings has wasted no time making its mark since going public. Revenue climbed 35% year over year to $115.1 million in the second quarter, while adjusted EBITDA increased 29% to $35.3 million. Earnings per share came in at $0.10, more than triple the prior-year level. A funded backlog of $719 million highlights long-term visibility. Growth was balanced across all its segments. Revenue increased by 22% for hypersonics and strategic missile defense, 39% for space and launch, and 46% for tactical missiles and IDS. This diversification ensures Karman isn’t leaning too heavily on any one segment. CEO Anthony Koblinski emphasized the company’s positive trajectory, pointing out that index inclusions and new contracts are strengthening Karman’s position in the defense and space industries. For investors with a high-risk appetite, Karman’s early momentum suggests it could evolve into a key player in the next generation of aerospace and defense. Overall, Wall Street rates this space stock a “Strong Buy.” Of the six analysts covering the stock, four rate it a “Strong Buy,” one rates it a “Moderate Buy,” and one rates it a “Hold.” Its average target price of $68.75 is roughly in line with its current trading price. However, the Street-high estimate of $100 suggests the stock has upside potential of 47% over the next 12 months. Growth Stock #2: Alphabet The second growth stock on my list is Alphabet (GOOG), Google’s parent company and a global technology powerhouse. Its primary source of revenue is digital advertising, but it also invests substantially in cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and breakthrough technologies that have the potential to alter the future. Valued at $2.99 trillion, GOOGL stock has climbed 30% year-to-date, outperforming the tech-led Nasdaq Composite Index’s ($NASX) gain of 15.6%. In the second quarter, Alphabet’s consolidated revenue climbed 14% year-over-year to $96.4 billion, while earnings per share surged 22% to $2.31. Growth was broad-based, with double-digit gains in Search, YouTube, subscriptions, and Google Cloud. CEO Sundar Pichai emphasized that AI is now driving every part of the business, with innovations rolling out at record speed. Google Services remained the business’s backbone, accounting for $82.5 billion in revenue, a 12% increase. Search increased by 12% to $54.2 billion, driven by gains in retail and financial services. Google Cloud was the main star, with sales jumping 32% to $13.6 billion and an operating margin that increased from 11.3% to 20.7%. Cloud’s backlog surpassed $106 billion, indicating strong demand for AI-powered products, Workspace, and business solutions. Several billion-dollar agreements signed in the first half reflect the segment’s steady progress. Alphabet ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet, holding $95 billion in cash and marketable securities. With AI fueling innovation across products, Alphabet is investing heavily in infrastructure to enable its next phase of growth. Overall, on Wall Street, GOOGL stock is a “Strong Buy.” Of the 54 analysts covering the stock, 40 rate it a “Strong Buy,” five say it is a “Moderate Buy,” and nine rate it a “Hold.” GOOGL stock has surpassed its average target price of $241.53. However, its high price estimate of $300 suggests the stock has upside potential of 22% over the next 12 months. Growth Stock #3: Micron Technology The third and final on my list of growth stocks is Micron Technology (MU). Valued at $181 billion, Micron is a semiconductor company that designs, manufactures, and sells memory and storage solutions used in everything from consumer electronics to advanced data centers. Fueled by a robust end to fiscal 2025, Micron stock has surged 85.5% year-to-date, wildly outperforming the broader market index. Micron Technology ended fiscal 2025 on a high note. Revenue surged nearly 50% year-over-year to an all-time high of $37.4 billion, while gross margins expanded to 41%. Data center sales emerged as the driving force behind Micron’s growth, accounting for 56% of total revenue and a 52% margin. High-bandwidth memory (HBM) stood out, delivering approximately $2 billion in Q4 revenue and establishing Micron as a top supplier of HBM3E and the next HBM4 generation. Collaboration with Nvidia (NVDA) and other hyperscale customers has solidified Micron’s position in powering AI servers and next-generation data centers. Looking ahead, Micron is investing aggressively to meet rising demand. New fabs in Idaho, New York, Japan, and Singapore are in development, supported by CHIPS Act funding and strategic partnerships. Demand tailwinds from AI servers, enterprise workloads, AI-ready PCs, and smartphones with higher memory content are expected to sustain momentum into fiscal 2026. Overall, on Wall Street, Micron stock has earned a “Strong Buy” rating. Out of the 36 analysts covering MU, 25 rate it a “Strong Buy,” five rate it a “Moderate Buy,” five recommend a “Hold,” and one says it is a “Strong Sell.” The stock is trading close to its average target price of $163.38. However, its Street-high estimate of $200 implies an upside potential of 28% over the next 12 months.

1c139167c642bb416832167f74181637d7e66015a4a10490bfc7dbdb4d8e5d51,GOOGL,"Tesla Robotaxis Could Be Coming Soon to Arizona . Should You Buy , Sell , or Hold TSLA Stock Here ? ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-robotaxis-could-coming-soon-194645922.html,finance.yahoo.com,20250926T064500Z,semi,0.65,"What once sounded like science fiction is quietly rolling onto American streets. Robotaxis—self-driving cars you summon on demand—are no longer just an idea scribbled on Silicon Valley whiteboards. Built to be cost-effective, efficient, and cleaner than traditional cabs, these vehicles promise a future where getting around town means no driver, no hassle. And Tesla (TSLA) is racing hard toward that future, even as a growing pack of rivals tries to stake their claim. Elon Musk’s company jumped into this race a few months ago, launching its robotaxi program in Austin, then expanding into California and securing approvals in Nevada. Now Arizona has given the green light, allowing Teslas that steer themselves to hit Phoenix roads. But Arizona regulators cleared its service with safety drivers still in place. The move puts Tesla shoulder-to-shoulder with other players already running empty vehicles in the region. Backed by its Full Self-Driving (FSD) tech and a brand cultlike in its following, Tesla’s expansion feels like the next big chapter. But with rivals already entrenched, regulators watching closely, and safety still under the microscope after recent mishaps, should investors lean in on TSLA or wait it out? About Tesla Stock Tesla, a Texas powerhouse valued at over $1.4 trillion by market capitalization, has evolved from an ambitious EV startup into a global innovator. Guided by Elon Musk, it blends EVs, battery storage, solar energy, and robotics into one ecosystem. The company shapes mobility, powers cities sustainably, and constantly pushes boundaries, keeping the world fixated on its next move. Tesla’s 2025 journey has been volatile. The year opened with the electric vehicle (EV) pioneer stumbling hard—shares cratered after a brutal first quarter, worsened by Trump’s April tariff punch. Add in slowing deliveries, rising Chinese competition, and Musk’s political escapades, and Tesla was staring at its ugliest stretch since 2022. Investors were rattled, and TSLA stock bottomed out in the spring, marking a low of $214.25 in April. But fast-forward to September, and Tesla has flipped the script. Over the month, the stock has roared back more than 28%, erasing its year-to-date (YTD) losses. The spark was a blockbuster insider move, with Musk himself buying 2.568 million shares worth roughly $1 billion, his first purchase in five years. That, paired with renewed optimism about Tesla’s long-term growth amid the Robotaxi launch in Arizona, catapulted the stock to $444.98 on Sept. 22, a massive 104% rebound off April’s lows. Shares now sit nearly 72% higher over the past 52 weeks, with momentum that few saw coming. As I’ve already mentioned in my last piece, TSLA’s chart flashed caution, and technical signals hinted at a breather. The 14-day RSI sits above 75, flashing overbought territory. Plus, what really caught my eye is how Tesla broke above the $430 resistance level, a key barrier that had been capping momentum. After briefly slipping to $425, it powered right back to nearly $440 in today’s trading session, proving buyers are still in control. The next resistance is sitting near $448. If Tesla clears that level, it could open the door to more upside, but if it stalls there, a pullback wouldn’t surprise me. Tesla’s Q2 Earnings Miss On July 23, Tesla released its Q2 2025 earnings report, and honestly, it did not exactly thrill Wall Street. After the bell, the company showed a revenue beat but missed on profits. Revenue hit $22.5 billion, which was down 12% year-over-year (YoY), while EPS slipped 23% annually to $0.27. Deliveries came in at 384,122, off more than 13%, highlighting the drag from an aging lineup and relentless pressure from Chinese competitors. Automotive revenues slid 16%, and those once-reliable regulatory credit sales nearly got cut in half. Still, there were some bright spots. Gross margins clocked in at 17.2%, better than expected even after a $300 million tariff bite, thanks to stronger efficiency from the refreshed Model Y. Tesla’s cash pile showcases resilience, sitting at $36.8 billion. But the flip side was free cash flow, which shrank to only $146 million, a steep fall from $1.3 billion last year, showing how capital-heavy the business has become. Elon Musk kept up his trademark mix of realism and moonshot vision on the earnings call. He warned about tough macro headwinds and even walked back Tesla’s 2025 delivery guidance. Yet he doubled down on autonomy and robotics, predicting unsupervised FSD this year and mass production of Optimus robots within five. Wall Street’s watchful eyes are bracing for a bumpy ride with Tesla. Analysts expect the EV giant’s bottom line to take a sharp hit in 2025, with EPS falling 41% YoY to just $1.20. But the forecasts hint at a swift turnaround in the next fiscal year, potentially catapulting EPS back up to $2 in 2026, signaling a bright rebound on the horizon. The Road Ahead for Tesla Robotaxis Tesla’s robotaxis are envisioned as fully autonomous vehicles designed to operate without a human driver, powered by the company’s advanced FSD technology. Built on artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and billions of miles of real-world data, these vehicles are designed to navigate dense urban environments safely. Tesla’s robotaxis aim to revolutionize urban mobility—cheaper, faster, and greener than traditional ride-hailing. CEO Musk envisions millions serving half the U.S. by 2025, cutting emissions, easing congestion, and reshaping transit. Autonomous fleets could slash fares, boost availability, and rival taxis and apps, powering Tesla’s next growth engine while staying true to its sustainable energy mission. Yet, the road ahead is not without hurdles. Regulatory approvals remain critical, with rules varying across states and countries. Safety concerns and consumer skepticism also loom large. The competitive landscape is also fierce. Alphabet’s (GOOG) (GOOGL) Waymo leads the field, operating fully driverless services across several U.S. cities and delivering hundreds of thousands of paid rides weekly. Amazon’s (AMZN) Zoox, though newer, brings a fresh design and the financial muscle of its parent company to back its rollout in Las Vegas and beyond. Both players have carved out early leads, and their progress keeps the pressure on Tesla to accelerate. What Do Analysts Expect for TSLA Stock? Recently, Mizuho Securities boosted TSLA’s price target to $450 from $375, citing resilient EV demand, easing tariff concerns, and rising production volumes. Analysts expect 1.91 million deliveries in 2026, fueled by the upcoming low-cost Model 2 and potential Robotaxi launches. Retaining an “Outperform” rating, Mizuho sees Tesla holding U.S. EV leadership, with Musk’s massive pay package and stock purchase aligning incentives for ambitious projects like autonomy and humanoid robots. Piper Sandler turned more bullish on TSLA over the weekend, lifting its price target to $500 from $400. Analyst Alex Potter, fresh off a China visit, called Tesla the firm’s “top idea” in autonomous vehicles and robotics, defending its lofty valuation as a reflection of AI’s potential to disrupt massive markets. The bull run talk was even more prominent on Friday when Tesla got a fresh jolt of optimism from Baird, with analyst Ben Kallo upgrading the stock to “Outperform” and jacking the price target up to $548 from $320. Kallo’s pitch was that Tesla isn’t being treated like just another car company anymore but valued as a physical AI powerhouse. Sure, recent EV sales have looked soft, but Wall Street’s gaze has shifted to what Musk is really selling—a future built on robotics, autonomous mobility, and AI. Baird anticipates that by 2035, Tesla could sell 20 million cars, rack up 10 million active FSD subscriptions, put one million robotaxis on the road, and sell a million Optimus robots at $20,000 each, at 50% gross margins. That kind of scale, the analyst says, could push Tesla’s market cap past $5.5 trillion, with the stock at around $1,412. And if Musk somehow doubles those milestones, you are looking at a $12 trillion valuation and shares trading north of $3,000. Kallo stressed that is not the base case, but it does paint a wild picture of just how big Tesla could get if its AI bets pay off. Despite TSLA's recent positive developments, Wall Street can’t seem to agree on Tesla. The stock carries a “Hold” rating overall, reflecting a split camp of believers and skeptics. Out of 42 analysts offering recommendations on TSLA, 13 advise a “Strong Buy,” two call it a “Moderate Buy,” 17 prefer to sit on the fence with “Hold,” while 10 are outright bearish with “Strong Sell.” While the EV stock is already trading above its average price target of $315.19, Baird’s street-high target of $548 suggests there is still nearly 29% upside if its bullish vision plays out. Final Thoughts on Tesla Tesla’s Robotaxi approval in Arizona adds a thrilling new chapter—a mix of excitement and caution. TSLA stock is surging, but safety concerns and rivals like Waymo, Zoox, and General Motors’ (GM) Cruise keep investors on edge. If Musk nails execution, expands FSD adoption, and builds public trust, the upside could be massive. Slip-ups, however, could hand the spotlight to competitors. TSLA today feels like holding on tight to a speed train—thrilling, unpredictable, and definitely not for the faint-hearted.

Should You Buy GOOGL Stock Here ? ,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-now-worth-3-trillion-130002835.html,finance.yahoo.com,20250920T151500Z,semi,0.65,"After months of navigating regulatory hurdles and the constant looming threat of being forced to divest its Chrome browser by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google has finally started to see brighter days on Wall Street. Earlier this month, a federal judge handed down an antitrust ruling that came in far lighter than investors feared, and, most importantly, confirmed that Google won’t have to sell its Chrome browser. That clarity helped lift a major cloud over GOOGL stock, and sparked a surge in confidence. Of course, the market wasted no time rewarding the news. Following this favorable ruling, the company added billions of dollars in market value. On Sept. 15, the stock closed up roughly 4.5% to become the fourth company to officially join the $3 trillion market capitalization club, a rarefied space shared only by Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Apple (AAPL). This milestone arrives some 20 years after Google’s public market debut, marking a defining moment in its growth story. Even more notable is that Google now stands as the second-best-performing “Magnificent Seven” stock in 2025, just behind Meta Platforms (META) and outshining even artificial intelligence (AI) darling Nvidia. So, with regulatory clouds lifting and momentum on its side, should you buy GOOGL stock now? About Google Stock Powered by a wide range of revenue streams, Google’s dominance in tech is hard to overlook. The California-based tech giant has its footprint across nearly every corner of the digital world, from its cash-cow ad business and rapidly scaling cloud division to ad-supported streaming, self-driving technology, and even healthcare innovation. However, as technology continues to advance at a rapid pace, what sets Google apart now is its early bet on AI. Long before AI became the market’s hottest trend, the company was weaving it into core offerings like search, YouTube, and Maps. Now, those efforts have culminated in Gemini, Google’s flagship suite of AI models, which sits at the heart of its strategy to compete at the very top of the AI race. With its market capitalization now hovering around $3 trillion, shares of this mega-cap stock are performing well on Wall Street, thanks to the favorable antitrust ruling and strong AI momentum. Over the past 52 weeks, GOOGL stock has skyrocketed nearly 60%, outshining the S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) 18% gain. So far this year, the stock is up about 33%, while the broader index has returned a modest 13% year-to-date (YTD). On Sept. 18, Google notched a new high of $253.99 and now trades only slightly below that level, maintaining strong momentum on Wall Street. Digging Into Google’s Q2 Performance Google reported its fiscal 2025 second-quarter results on July 23, and the numbers came in well ahead of Wall Street’s expectations. Revenue rose 14% year-over-year (YOY) to $96.4 billion, topping the $94 billion consensus estimate. EPS climbed 22% to $2.31, beating estimates by a 7.4% margin. Operating income increased 14% to $31.3 billion, and operating margin came in at 32% thanks to strong top-line growth and expense discipline. By quarter-end, Google held a hefty $95 billion in cash and marketable securities. Diving deeper, Google Cloud once again stole the spotlight. Revenue surged 32% YOY to $13.6 billion, driven by the rapid adoption of Google Cloud Platform’s (GCP) core offerings, AI infrastructure, and generative AI solutions. Cloud backlog reached a whopping $106 billion at the end of Q2, up 18% sequentially and 38% from last year, underscoring strong and sustained demand from both new and existing customers. Search and advertising, Google’s backbone businesses, also delivered solid results despite intensifying AI competition. Search revenue rose 11.7% YOY to $54.1 billion, while total advertising climbed 10.4% to $71.3 billion. These results highlight the company’s ability to preserve its market strength even as rivals push AI-powered alternatives. CEO Sundar Pichai emphasized the company’s rapid progress on the AI front in the Q2 earnings call. Gemini app, home to Google’s AI chatbot, now boasts more than 450 million monthly active users. Meanwhile, AI Overviews, the AI-powered search tool that summarizes results, has expanded to over 2 billion monthly users across more than 200 countries and territories. To support this momentum, Google is also stepping up its investment plans. The company now expects to spend roughly $85 billion in capital expenditures in fiscal 2025, compared with its earlier estimate of $75 billion. Management attributed the increase to surging demand for cloud services and AI-driven solutions, signaling just how quickly the business is scaling. What Do Analysts Think About Google Stock? Recently, Evercore ISI raised its price target on GOOGL stock to $300 from $240, while maintaining an “Outperform” rating on the tech giant. The upgrade comes after the investment firm’s sixth quarterly search survey, which showed Google holding its lead in commercial-intent searches even as competition in general search heats up. According to Evercore, Google’s generative AI push is making search “an overall better Search Engine for users,” a shift they believe will fuel “consistently strong Search Revenue growth” for the company. On top of that, Evercore called Google its “Top Large Cap Long” pick, pointing to several growth drivers such as YouTube’s ad momentum, Google Cloud’s steady performance, and Waymo’s growing robotaxi rollout. Overall, Wall Street remains largely bullish about GOOGL’s prospects, with the stock carrying a consensus “Strong Buy” rating. Among 54 analysts covering the stock, a majority of 40 analysts call it a “Strong Buy,” five lean toward a “Moderate Buy,” and the remaining nine have a “Hold' rating. This year’s rally has pushed GOOGL stock above the average analyst price target of $236.53. However, the most bullish target on the Street of $300, assigned by Evercore ISI, indicates 19% potential upside from current levels, leaving plenty of room for new highs ahead.

Should You Buy AVGO Stock Here ? ,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/broadcom-just-scored-major-openai-160439829.html,finance.yahoo.com,20250912T233000Z,semi,0.65,"The AI chip market is growing at a rapid pace, with the global semiconductor industry expected to top $697 billion in revenue this year, an increase of more than 11% from 2024, according to Statista. Much of this growth is being driven by generative AI and rising demand from large tech platforms. In this environment, Broadcom (AVGO) landed its fourth major AI customer, which multiple analysts believe to be OpenAI, through a $10 billion order for specialized AI server racks. The company disclosed on Sept. 5 that the customer placed production orders for its custom-designed artificial intelligence chips. Following the announcement, AVGO stock jumped 19.54% in just five days. The company also reported record revenue of $15.95 billion for Q3 2025, up 22% from the prior year, with its AI semiconductor revenue climbing 63%. The challenge now lies in valuation. Does this OpenAI partnership justify adding AVGO shares to portfolios at current prices, or has the recent rally pushed the stock beyond attractive entry points? Let’s find out. How Broadcom’s Earnings Stack Up Broadcom operates across both semiconductors and infrastructure software, with a business that ranges from building custom chips for hyperscalers to offering VMware-based enterprise solutions. This mix has paid off for investors. AVGO has climbed more than 131% over the past year and is up another 45% so far in 2025. The move has pushed valuations higher, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 61x, well above the sector average of 24x. Even at those levels, Broadcom continues to offer income support through dividends, yielding 2.30% compared to the technology sector’s 1.37%. The company has increased its payout for 15 years in a row and now pays $0.59 per share each quarter, with a forward payout ratio of 25.8%, leaving plenty of room for future growth. The latest financial results explain why investors are willing to pay a premium. Revenue for the third quarter reached a record $15.95 billion, up 22% year-over-year (YoY). Profitability remained strong, with adjusted EBITDA of $10.7 billion, or 67% of revenue. GAAP net income came in at $4.14 billion, while non-GAAP figures nearly doubled that at $8.4 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $0.85 on a GAAP basis and $1.69 on a non-GAAP basis, showing the strength of underlying operations. Free cash flow was also impressive, coming in at $7.02 billion, equal to 44% of sales, reflecting Broadcom’s ability to convert revenue into consistent cash returns. What’s Powering Broadcom’s Next Leg of Growth The single biggest driver for Broadcom right now is a $10 billion order for custom AI chips, widely believed to be from OpenAI. Reports indicate the two companies worked together to design semiconductors that are expected to launch next year. This adds OpenAI to Broadcom’s existing roster of major customers like Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), Meta (META), and ByteDance. Winning a hyperscaler of this size strengthens Broadcom’s position in the fast-growing AI market and creates a steady source of demand in one of the most expensive areas of technology. Alongside its chip business, Broadcom is leaning on software to win enterprise deals. A recent partnership with Walmart (WMT) highlights this approach. Broadcom was tapped as a strategic vendor for virtualization software, using VMware Cloud Foundation to modernize Walmart’s private cloud and edge operations around the world. These kinds of relationships have the potential to deliver recurring, long-term revenue from companies outside the hyperscaler group. Broadcom is also expanding deeper into the AI ecosystem through new partnerships. Its collaboration with Nvidia (NVDA) will bring advanced AI capabilities into VMware Cloud Foundation, helping enterprises and cloud providers train and deploy new models more easily. At the same time, Broadcom’s expanded partnership with Canonical focuses on optimizing container-based and AI workloads, combining open-source software with VCF to cut costs and speed up the delivery of next-generation applications. What Wall Street Sees Ahead for Broadcom Looking to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, Broadcom expects revenue of about $17.4 billion, which would be a 24% increase from last year, with adjusted EBITDA likely to hold near a strong 67% margin. Analysts forecast earnings per share of $1.48 in October 2025, up 18.4% from the same quarter a year ago. HSBC recently reinforced this positive trend by upgrading Broadcom from “Hold” to “Buy” and raising its price target by 70% to $400. Analyst Frank Lee highlighted Broadcom’s ASIC, or application-specific integrated circuit, business as a key driver, saying it has been undervalued compared to its growth potential. HSBC now projects ASIC revenue to reach $28.4 billion in fiscal 2026 and $42.8 billion in fiscal 2027, pointing to accelerating demand for customized, high-performance chips that Broadcom is well placed to deliver. Other analysts share the same view. All 39 covering AVGO currently rate the stock a consensus “Strong Buy,” with the average price target set at $364.29. At a current share price of about $336.67, that leaves an expected upside of nearly 8.2% from here. Conclusion Broadcom’s reported $10 billion win with OpenAI is a game-changer, putting it firmly among the top tier of AI chip suppliers, but the stock isn’t cheap. At a forward P/E more than double the sector average, a lot of that optimism is already priced in. Still, with earnings accelerating, new enterprise partnerships rolling in, and analysts unanimously bullish, it’s hard to argue against adding AVGO if you’re thinking long term. Shares may see some near-term consolidation after the recent run-up, but the direction looks higher over the next year as AI adoption ramps up and Broadcom’s custom chip pipeline starts delivering in full.

In a post-earnings research note today, Sur reiterated his “Overweight” rating on AVGO shares and raised his price target to $400, indicating potential upside of nearly 20% from current levels. More News from Barchart Broadcom stock has already been a lucrative investment in 2025. At the time of writing, AVGO is up more than 140% versus its low set in the first week of April. What Could Drive Broadcom Stock Higher? JPM recommends sticking with AVGO stock because a diversified portfolio and accelerating AI demand could drive it much higher from here. Additionally, “continued momentum from VMware and product cycles also support solid revenue growth profile,” the investment firm told clients in a research note on Friday. The company’s AI-driven revenue is now on course to hitting $20 billion this year. With a record $110 billion backlog, Broadcom shares are well-positioned for sustained growth. A 0.71% dividend yield makes AVGO shares even more exciting as a long-term holding. AVGO Shares Warrant Premium Multiple Broadcom stock is worth owning here also because the company’s management also announced a mystery $10 billion AI customer on Friday that many are speculating is OpenAI. Among other reasons Harlan Sur cited for the constructive view on AVGO shares include Google’s (GOOGL) next-gen TPU ramp. While this AI stock at a forward price-earnings (P/E) multiple of more than 55x is not inexpensive to own, its EBITDA margin of about 67% does support the premium valuation. Note that Broadcom generated a record $7 billion in free cash flow last quarter, up 47% year-over-year, highlighting strong operating leverage and capital return potential. How Wall Street Recommends Playing Broadcom Shares Other Wall Street firms that raised their price objectives on AVGO stock after the chipmaker’s Q2 earnings release today include Bank of America Securities, Barclays, and Deutsche Bank. In fact, the consensus rating on Broadcom shares currently sits at “Strong Buy,” according to Barchart."

To make that kind of money, you almost certainly need astuteness and insight that goes beyond the ordinary. That seems to be the case with David Tepper. Early in his career, Tepper led junk bond trading for Goldman Sachs. He started a hedge fund, Appaloosa Management, in 1993. The rest is history. Tepper's net worth today stands at $23.7 billion. Google parent Alphabet (GOOG 0.86%) (GOOGL 0.82%) and Meta Platforms (META 0.82%) rank among Appaloosa's largest holdings. But does Tepper know something about them that Wall Street doesn't? Tepper's big Q2 moves with Alphabet and Meta Tepper first bought Alphabet's class C shares (the tech giant has three share classes, but only the class A and class C shares trade on public stock exchanges) in 2015. His hedge fund has owned the stock ever since. However, the billionaire doesn't seem to be as enamored with Alphabet as he used to be. Appaloosa's 13F filing for the second quarter of 2025 revealed that Tepper sold 510,000 shares, reducing the hedge fund's stake in Alphabet by around 25%. Tepper's relationship with Meta goes back even farther. He initiated a new position in the stock (then known as Facebook) in 2014, but sold all the shares in the same year. In 2016, Tepper bought Meta again. This time, he held on. But Appaloosa sold 150,000 shares of Meta in Q2. This move slashed the hedge fund's stake in the social media giant by more than 27%. Wall Street has a different take on these stocks How do Tepper's sales of Alphabet and Meta align with Wall Street's take on the two ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks? Not very well. Of the 66 analysts surveyed by LSEG in August, 54 rated Alphabet as a ""buy"" or ""strong buy,"" with the remaining 12 recommending holding the stock. An overwhelming majority (58) of the 67 analysts surveyed by LSEG rated Meta as a ""buy"" or ""strong buy."" All but one of the other analysts recommended holding the stock, with one lone outlier giving it a ""sell"" rating. Granted, the average 12-month price target for Alphabet is only a few percentage points higher than the current share price. However, analysts project that Meta's stock could jump roughly 15% over the next year. Why is there such a disconnect between Tepper's and Wall Street's views on Alphabet and Meta? It isn't because the billionaire hedge fund manager has soured on AI stocks. Tepper bought additional shares of Amazon (AMZN -0.61%) and Nvidia (NVDA 0.86%), among others, in Q2. I doubt that valuation was a major concern for Tepper, either. Both Alphabet's and Meta's share prices tumbled in Q2 to levels lower than the first quarter, when he bought additional shares of both stocks. The reason for Tepper's sales of these two stocks is puzzling. Don't follow the billionaire on this one Does Tepper know something about these AI stocks that analysts don't? Maybe, but I don't believe he does. Either way, I agree with the consensus on Wall Street that both Alphabet and Meta are good picks for investors. Google Cloud remains the fastest-growing of the three biggest cloud service providers. Google Search and YouTube are booming. Generative AI is proving to be a help for Google rather than a hindrance. Alphabet's Waymo unit has a huge opportunity as the robotaxi market takes off. Meta's family of social media apps, including Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp, continues to attract big bucks from advertisers. The company could enjoy tremendous growth as the adoption of AI glasses increases. Meta even offers a lottery ticket of sorts with its investment in AI superintelligence. I think Tepper is brilliant and one of the best hedge fund managers ever. In the case of Alphabet and Meta, though, I suspect the best move for long-term investors is to not follow in the billionaire's footsteps."
169a8cda3fdfafda99b7abe7884144f8019afa67552adeed477f7f9b2ffe661d,GOOGL,Could Alphabet Be About to Start Mining Bitcoin ? ,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/26/could-alphabet-be-about-to-start-mining-bitcoin/?source=iedfolrf0000001,www.fool.com,20250826T153000Z,semi,0.65,"By agreeing to backstop leases at a New York data center campus run by TeraWulf (WULF 0.51%), Alphabet (GOOG 0.86%) (GOOGL 0.82%) picked up some stock warrants that could translate into a meaningful equity stake in a company that mines Bitcoin (BTC 1.73%). The internet search giant is not buying coins directly, and it isn't buying a mining company outright. But the economic exposure here is still real enough to matter for investors, so let's investigate what happened in more detail. Don't expect the balance sheet to change much In short, Alphabet's Google agreed to support long-term lease obligations tied to a build-out at TeraWulf's Lake Mariner campus near Buffalo, New York. In return, Google received stock warrants that, if exercised, would increase its equity stake in TeraWulf to roughly 14%, building on a previous backstop that gave it warrants that could give it an 8% stake if exercised. Alphabet's cumulative backstop commitment connected to the project now totals about $3.2 billion. For a company of its enormous size, with more than $95 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments on hand as of the most recent quarterly earnings report, such a commitment is minor, and it doesn't signal any sweeping changes in strategy. TeraWulf is, importantly, a U.S.-based Bitcoin mining business, though it has other operating segments as well, including artificial intelligence (AI) services and data centers. Alphabet is therefore not accumulating Bitcoin on its balance sheet, nor would its warrants, if exercised, imply that it holds or plans to buy the coin. If anything, it probably sees an advantage in having the option to own a stake in a player that provides the data and computing infrastructure it needs at industrial scale, with the mining activities being incidental in the context of the overall package. But by accepting warrants issued by a Bitcoin miner, Alphabet is nonetheless positioning itself for equity-mediated participation in Bitcoin's economics, though at a small scale relative to its main operations. After all, the value of such mining companies is tied directly to the price of Bitcoin and how much of it they can produce given their computing power. So if Bitcoin's price went up by a lot, it would thus increase the value of TeraWulf, which itself holds and produces the asset, thereby increasing the value of Alphabet's non-controlling stake, assuming it opts to exercise the warrants to actually gain control of its equity at some point. An added advantage of owning a stake in a mining company rather than just buying Bitcoin directly is that companies can employ leverage to bolster their returns. What it means for Bitcoin itself If you are a Bitcoin holder, the signal from Alphabet's acceptance of TeraWulf's warrants is modestly positive. A megacap platform company is comfortable with indirect exposure to the asset's ups and downs via a mining operator. That can help normalize the asset class for other big businesses evaluating their own exposure paths. Alphabet wouldn't be taking any warrants from a mining company if it thought the primary asset it produces is worthless or going to zero. At the same time, this event is not something that you should think of as a strong buy signal. Even if Alphabet exercises its warrants, it isn't about to be an important player in Bitcoin mining, nor is it likely to become one in the future. In other words, this is another data point that large, sophisticated companies are comfortable securing equity-based exposure to the Bitcoin ecosystem even if their shareholders might balk at getting direct exposure via buying and holding the asset. There are already quite a few data points in that set, but there's always room for more confirmation of a bullish trend."
27765e18a7c39c4a03ad9ef0fa23d897333f62478ccefa0fd7a733225c6d7b8b,GOOGL,2 Outstanding  Strong Buy  Stocks to Grab in August,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-outstanding-strong-buy-stocks-113002111.html,finance.yahoo.com,20250820T200000Z,semi,0.65,"For savvy investors looking for long-term businesses that not only dominate their industries today but also have the innovation engine to continue leading tomorrow, two stocks stand out to me. For long-term investors looking to diversify their portfolio, two consistent cash-generating businesses, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Eli Lilly (LLY), are the best bets this month. Why Google Stock Deserves a Spot in Your Portfolio The first on my list is Google’s parent company, Alphabet. With a market cap of $2.5 trillion, Alphabet is a tech giant with dominance across search, advertising, video, and cloud computing. Now, the company is also reinventing itself at the heart of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. GOOGL stock is up 7.3% year-to-date, underperforming the tech-led Nasdaq Composite Index’s ($NASX) gain of 11.8%. In the second quarter, total revenue hit $96.4 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Earnings rose 22% year-over-year to $2.31 per share. Search remains Alphabet’s most important business and its largest revenue driver, and it is thriving in the AI era. Search revenue jumped 11.7% to $54.2 billion. Another highlight of Q2 was Google Cloud's performance driven by AI. Cloud revenue jumped 32% year-over-year to $13.6 billion, with the backlog reaching $106 billion, up 38% year-over-year. Both new customers and existing enterprises are trusting Google’s differentiated AI-first cloud offering. Additionally, YouTube's revenue increased by 13% year over year, fueled by both brand advertising and direct response. Alphabet is increasing capital expenditures to $85 billion in 2025, mostly in servers and data centers, to meet the rapidly increasing demand for cloud and AI. Despite significant investments in technical infrastructure, free cash flow over the past 12 months totalled $66.7 billion. Alphabet returned $13.6 billion through share repurchases and $2.5 billion in dividends in Q2 alone, rewarding investors while maintaining $100 billion in cash and equivalents. Thanks to this financial firepower, it can continue to make significant investments in AI and provide value to shareholders. Overall, on Wall Street, GOOGL stock is a “Strong Buy.” Of the 54 analysts covering the stock, 41 rate it a “Strong Buy,” four say it is a “Moderate Buy,” and nine rate it a “Hold.” The average target price of $220.92 implies the stock can climb by 8.4% from current levels. Plus, its high price estimate of $250 suggests the stock has an upside potential of 24% over the next 12 months. Alphabet has strong moats thanks to its double-digit growth in Search, accelerating momentum in YouTube, and a thriving Google Cloud business. Furthermore, new growth bets on autonomous driving and a full-stack AI strategy position the company as one of the most attractive opportunities in big tech right now. Why Eli Lilly Stock Deserves a Spot in Your Portfolio The second stock on my list is Eli Lilly, a global pharmaceutical powerhouse, valued at $663 billion. Aside from its leadership in the booming market for weight-loss and diabetes therapies, the company is developing ground-breaking treatments in oncology, neuroscience, and autoimmune diseases, among other areas. LLY stock has fallen 9.3% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) gain of 9.6%. Lilly’s current blockbuster products are already driving record sales. Mounjaro, which is used to treat both type-2 diabetes and obesity, has risen to the top of the total incretin prescription market in the U.S., according to management. Meanwhile, Zepbound maintains its dominance in the branded obesity drug market, accounting for two-thirds of all patients in this category. Mounjaro generated $5.2 billion in global sales in the second quarter alone, while Zepbound contributed $3.4 billion. Total revenue increased 38% year over year, gross margin rose to 85%, and earnings per share increased 61% to $6.31. These results were driven by significant volume growth in its flagship products. While incretin-based therapies dominate headlines, Lilly’s portfolio is diverse and extensive. In oncology, the company is developing drugs such as Jaypirca and Verzenio. In neuroscience, Kisunla, a treatment for Alzheimer’s disease, is gaining traction. Furthermore, Lilly is expanding into next-generation cardiovascular and genetic therapies through acquisitions such as Verve Therapeutics and SiteOne Therapeutics. Importantly, Lilly is aggressively reinvesting to ensure its long-term growth prospects. R&D spending increased by 23%, boosting both late-stage trials and early stage research in oncology, neuroscience, and cardiovascular health. Eli Lilly not only reinvests in growth, but it also rewards shareholders along the way. In Q2, the company paid out $1.3 billion in dividends and repurchased $700 million of stock. On Wall Street, Eli Lilly has earned an overall “Strong Buy” rating. Of the 27 analysts who cover the stock, 20 rate it a “Strong Buy,” two a “Moderate Buy,” and five recommend a “Hold.” The average analyst price target of $922.67 suggests a 32% increase from current levels. Furthermore, the Street-high estimate of $1,190 implies that the stock could rally by up to 70% over the next year. Eli Lilly offers a great combination of explosive short-term growth and durable long-term potential. Its dominance in obesity and diabetes, breakthrough results in oral GLP-1 therapy, expanding oncology and neuroscience portfolio, and disciplined financial strategy all point toward sustained outperformance.

You've probably heard the buzz about artificial intelligence (AI), but it's become harder to deny that it will play a big role in the future. Researchers estimate that AI will create trillions of dollars in economic output over the next five years, so the companies that lead the way will likely continue to reap significant growth. So if you're deciding where to put $1,000 right now, you may want to consider these three top AI stocks. They are already winners and could continue to perform well into the future. 1. Nvidia There may not be a bigger winner in the AI era than Nvidia (NVDA 0.86%). The company's chips are the gold standard used by AI hyperscalers, which continue to build massive data centers to house clusters of Nvidia's chips that work together to train and operate AI models. Some estimates peg Nvidia's data center GPU market share at over 90%. The rapid pace of innovation has made it difficult for competitors to keep up with Nvidia, whose next-gen AI chip is Rubin due next year, with Rubin Ultra scheduled for 2027. Even if competitors begin to chip away at Nvidia's dominance, the pie is growing so fast that Nvidia should continue to thrive. Experts believe global data center investments will approach $6.7 trillion over the next five years. Nvidia's business and share price have grown tremendously over the past few years, so growth is bound to slow for a company now worth over $4 trillion. Still, at a price-to-earnings ratio of 58, Nvidia remains a solid long-term buy, assuming it meets Wall Street's expectations of nearly 30% annualized long-term earnings growth as the AI era continues to hit its stride. 2. Amazon E-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (AMZN -0.61%) continues to plant seeds for expansion and long-term growth. Amazon Web Services is the world's largest cloud services platform, making the company a natural beneficiary of AI demand, which fuels cloud computing consumption. Additionally, its legacy e-commerce business still has plenty of upside. E-commerce accounts for less than 20% of total retail in the United States, and Amazon only recently began widespread same-day grocery delivery. Amazon also has other long-term catalysts in the works. It has quietly become one of the world's largest digital advertising platforms and has a vast subscriber base via its Prime membership, with an estimated 220 million paid subscriptions. That serves as a distribution channel for services, including Prime Video and telehealth. The company's core businesses still have plenty of juice to squeeze, which is why analysts estimate the company will grow earnings at an impressive 18% annualized pace over the long haul. That makes Amazon a strong buy at its current valuation and its current P/E ratio of 35. 3. Alphabet Google's parent company, Alphabet (GOOG 0.86%) (GOOGL 0.82%), faced some adversity over the past couple of years. Regulators successfully came after its search engine dominance, and investors have wondered whether the explosive popularity of AI chatbots like ChatGPT would render traditional search engines obsolete. At least thus far, Google continues to generate more revenue, so it seems that the two can coexist at this point. Meanwhile, Alphabet is investing to become a central player in AI. Google Cloud is the world's third-largest cloud services platform, and Alphabet has developed its own AI model, Gemini, to compete with ChatGPT and others. The company has even created and sold custom AI data center chips, making it arguably the most complete competitor in the AI space, having in-house offerings across the cloud, chips, and AI software. Alphabet's core business remains intact, and there is potential upside from other projects, such as Waymo, its autonomous ride-hailing subsidiary, and active development efforts in quantum computing. Wall Street anticipates Alphabet generating nearly 15% annualized long-term earnings growth. Despite the stock running to all-time highs, Alphabet remains an excellent deal for its expected earnings growth -- it trades at a P/E of just under 22 right now."

Investors were spooked also because the company said tariffs and the related uncertainty remained a lingering concern for advertisers in the second half of 2025. More News from Barchart - Should You Buy the 40% Post-Earnings Plunge in The Trade Desk Stock? - Stocks Settle Higher on Solid Earnings and Hopes for a Ukraine Peace Deal Pinterest stock has been in a sharp uptrend over the past four months. Despite today’s plunge, it’s up nearly 50% versus its low set in late April. Here’s Why the Q2 Release Is Still Positive for Pinterest Stock While the NYSE-listed firm did come in slightly shy of the EPS estimate for its Q2, the company’s financial release was, nonetheless, largely positive for long-term investors. For starters, Pinterest continued to grow its user base at an exciting pace, ending the quarter with 578 million monthly active users (MAUs), up some 3.5 million sequentially. More importantly, the San Francisco-headquartered company guided for $1.033 billion to $1.053 billion in revenue for its current financial quarter, handily beating analysts at $1.025 billion. Together, this suggests the post-earnings decline in PINS shares may be a buying opportunity, especially if you plan on owning them for the long term. BofA Recommends Buying the Dip in PINS Shares Bank of America analyst Justin Post recommends buying Pinterest shares on the post-earnings decline since the company’s revenue grew a more than expected 17% to nearly $1 billion in Q2. According to him, AI-powered advertising tools like Performance+ will likely unlock significant further upside in PINS stock in the back half of 2025. Additionally, Pinterest stands to benefit from expanding partnerships with the likes of Google (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN), the BofA analyst told clients in his research note today. The social media firm’s transformation into a personalized shopping and ad platform positions it to capture more market share and boost monetization, he added. Post raised his price target on Pinterest stock this morning to $44, indicating potential upside of well over 20% from here. Wall Street Has a ‘Strong Buy’ Rating on Pinterest Note that Wall Street analysts remain largely positive on PINS stock after its Q2 earnings release."

Tech stocks are the muscle behind U.S. markets these days, accounting for 34% of the makeup of the entire S&P 500. They are also outperformers, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is outperforming both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average so far this year. The lesson here? You need to have tech stocks in your portfolio if you want to outperform the market. Tech stocks are immensely popular these days as companies are racing to train large language models (LLMs) to customize their platforms with generative artificial intelligence (AI) offerings in order to roll out new services and customer experiences before their competitors. The race to build AI products is far from over, and buying stocks that will be best positioned to capitalize on the trend is a smart way to invest right now. If you're looking for the best tech stocks for August, I'm recommending Nvidia (NVDA 0.86%), Alphabet (GOOG 0.86%) (GOOGL 0.82%), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -1.59%). Nvidia The unquestioned leader in tech stocks right now is chipmaker Nvidia. As the creator of the most advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) that top companies use to power their AI platforms, Nvidia has grown to be the most valuable publicly traded company in the world and was the first to crack the $4 trillion milestone. Nvidia's GPUs can be combined with other chips into clusters that can work faster and more powerfully, which is why they are so prized by companies building AI applications. Jon Peddie Research estimates that Nvidia has a staggering 92% of the GPU market. The company will report earnings for its second quarter of fiscal 2026 on Aug. 27, and analysts are expecting another blowout quarter. Of 66 analysts who cover Nvidia on Yahoo! Finance, 59 of them rank Nvidia as a buy or strong buy. Alphabet Alphabet already reported its quarterly earnings, and Wall Street was impressed. Revenue in Q2 was up 14% to 96.4 billion, while net income was up 19% to $28.19 billion. Alphabet's earnings per share also jumped to $2.31, a 22% gain from a year ago. The report was a welcome return to form for Alphabet, which has struggled so far in 2025 amid concerns that platforms such as ChatGPT would eat into the company's massive Google search business. There are also legal issues, as Alphabet is battling with the Justice Department over allegations that it has an illegal monopoly, and there are concerns that the company could be split up. But Alphabet has been able to put those concerns to rest, at least for now. Revenue from Google Cloud was particularly strong in the second quarter, rising 32% to $13.6 billion, as the company's Google AI platform is incorporated into its Chrome browser and Google search engine. Alphabet also saw strong growth in Google Search (revenue was up 11.7%) and Google Advertising (up 10.4%). Alphabet's stock also trades at a low 20.6 price-to-earnings ratio --incredibly attractive for a tech stock that continues to show strong growth. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing This one goes hand-in-hand with Nvidia, really. If you believe in the growth story powering Nvidia's GPUs, then Taiwan Semiconductor, also known as TSMC, has the same kind of tailwinds. TSMC is a fabricator of GPUs -- it doesn't design them, but it is one of the biggest companies in the world that actually makes them for Nvidia and others. It's a rapidly growing field, as Mordor Intelligence says the GPU market will be $82.7 billion this year and explode to $352.5 billion by 2030. TSMC has an estimated 62% market share of the global foundry market, so it's going to benefit no matter which company has the lead in the GPU race over the next decade. Nvidia's major competitor, Advanced Micro Devices, is also a TSMC customer. TSMC is also growing its footprint in the U.S. rapidly, with plans to invest $165 billion in facilities in Arizona that should shield it from any tariff concerns in the future. TSMC's Q2 earnings included revenue of $30.07 billion, up 44.4% from a year ago. The company is projecting Q3 revenue even higher, to be between $31.8 billion and $33 billion. The bottom line Each of these companies is at the forefront of the explosive growth in AI, which is the dominant trend driving the stock market today. All of them would be excellent buys in August to capitalize on the market-driving power of tech stocks."

As the creator of the most advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) that top companies use to power their AI platforms, Nvidia has grown to be the most valuable publicly traded company in the world and was the first to crack the $4 trillion milestone. Nvidia's GPUs can be combined with other chips into clusters that can work faster and more powerfully, which is why they are so prized by companies building AI applications. Jon Peddie Research estimates that Nvidia has a staggering 92% of the GPU market. The company will report earnings for its second quarter of fiscal 2026 on Aug. 27, and analysts are expecting another blowout quarter. Of 66 analysts who cover Nvidia on Yahoo! Finance, 59 of them rank Nvidia as a buy or strong buy. Alphabet Alphabet already reported its quarterly earnings, and Wall Street was impressed. Revenue in Q2 was up 14% to 96.4 billion, while net income was up 19% to $28.19 billion. Alphabet's earnings per share also jumped to $2.31, a 22% gain from a year ago. The report was a welcome return to form for Alphabet, which has struggled so far in 2025 amid concerns that platforms such as ChatGPT would eat into the company's massive Google search business. There are also legal issues, as Alphabet is battling with the Justice Department over allegations that it has an illegal monopoly, and there are concerns that the company could be split up. But Alphabet has been able to put those concerns to rest, at least for now. Revenue from Google Cloud was particularly strong in the second quarter, rising 32% to $13.6 billion, as the company's Google AI platform is incorporated into its Chrome browser and Google search engine. Alphabet also saw strong growth in Google Search (revenue was up 11.7%) and Google Advertising (up 10.4%). Alphabet's stock also trades at a low 20.6 price-to-earnings ratio --incredibly attractive for a tech stock that continues to show strong growth. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing This one goes hand-in-hand with Nvidia, really. If you believe in the growth story powering Nvidia's GPUs, then Taiwan Semiconductor, also known as TSMC, has the same kind of tailwinds. TSMC is a fabricator of GPUs -- it doesn't design them, but it is one of the biggest companies in the world that actually makes them for Nvidia and others. It's a rapidly growing field, as Mordor Intelligence says the GPU market will be $82.7 billion this year and explode to $352.5 billion by 2030. TSMC has an estimated 62% market share of the global foundry market, so it's going to benefit no matter which company has the lead in the GPU race over the next decade. Nvidia's major competitor, Advanced Micro Devices, is also a TSMC customer. TSMC is also growing its footprint in the U.S. rapidly, with plans to invest $165 billion in facilities in Arizona that should shield it from any tariff concerns in the future. TSMC's Q2 earnings included revenue of $30.07 billion, up 44.4% from a year ago. The company is projecting Q3 revenue even higher, to be between $31.8 billion and $33 billion. The bottom line Each of these companies is at the forefront of the explosive growth in AI, which is the dominant trend driving the stock market today. All of them would be excellent buys in August to capitalize on the market-driving power of tech stocks.

(NYSE:FI) reported 8% year-over-year revenue growth and earnings per share above estimates. However, the company revised the upper end of its full-year organic growth guidance downward due to a slowdown in its merchant segment, which grew 9% year-over-year, down from 11% in the prior quarter. A major issue stems from the corporation’s Clover platform. Previously, merchants using the Payeezy platform were migrated to Clover due to issues with Payeezy, temporarily boosting Clover’s revenue and gross payment volume.

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the top recommended stocks. Brent Thill of Jefferies recently talked about a study on AI chatbots his team conducted and discussed the results. Based on the research results, Jefferies believes Google Gemini could become the leading copilot for consumers. Here is what Thill said: “We took 10 questions. We took our entire research team and we had the team independently go through and use Perplexity, ChatGPT, and Google Gemini. And everyone independently scored what they found, whether it was looking for a laptop, looking for shoes, effectively doing a restaurant search, completely different skills in terms of what we were looking for. And we then ranked it and ChatGPT came out ahead overall on the scoring, but Gemini was right there from Google in a very close position.” Thill said different chatbots have their own strengths and weaknesses, and we may need multiple tools instead of relying on a single one. “We see a future where we’re all going to have multiple agents working for us because all the agents have different strengths and that maybe at one point we’re going to need an agent to manage all the agents because there’s going to be so many great agents. One may be good at booking restaurant reservations, one might be good looking for other, more advanced things. So overall, we’re continued to be bullish about Google’s position in this.” Google has an edge over competitors because it’s easier for the billions of users of its search engine to switch to Gemini instead of opting for a completely new model. Google has over 1.5 billion monthly users interacting with its AI-powered Search overviews. OpenAI, Alphabet’s biggest competitor now when it comes to AI search, has less than 5% of its users paying, and its business model is still developing. Google’s first-quarter results showed continued strength in its cloud unit, with revenue up 28% year over year and solid operating income growth. This supports Google’s broader AI strategy and underscores the scale advantages of its cloud business. Mairs & Power Balanced Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter: “Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) led underperformance in the Communications sector during the first half of the year as there is increasing concern about the impact of generative AI on Alphabet’s search business and whether it will be able to meaningfully respond. We have been trimming the Fund’s holdings in Alphabet as part of the transition to Amazon but also to reflect lower confidence in the company’s ability to maintain its competitive advantage longer term."

Its GPUs power everything from ChatGPT to self-driving cars, and its market capitalization surged past $4 trillion, firmly establishing the chipmaker as the largest company in the world. Yet as the AI race matures, the next decade may not belong to Nvidia alone. Two companies -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -1.59%) and Alphabet (GOOGL 0.82%) (GOOG 0.86%) -- are quietly positioning themselves to challenge its dominance from distinct but equally powerful angles. Nvidia's rise has largely been fueled by its high-performance chips, but the broader AI ecosystem relies on companies that supply crucial infrastructure and integrated platforms enabling this revolution. By 2030, investors may look back and realize that the true winners of the AI boom were those laying the foundation of the intelligent economy. 1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing: The ultimate pick-and-shovel AI stock While Nvidia specializes in designing GPUs, its Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC for short) that brings this hardware to life. As the world's largest chip manufacturer by revenue, it produces cutting-edge 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer chips that power not only Nvidia's products, but also those of Advanced Micro Devices and Apple's M series processors. In many ways, TSMC is the pillar supporting the broader semiconductor industry. As global demand for AI computing accelerates, the company's value proposition grows increasingly compelling. Its dominance in advanced node manufacturing should drive sustained revenue growth and expanding profit margins, backed by industry-leading pricing power. Moreover, TSMC's strategic investments to diversify its geographic footprint beyond Taiwan -- including new production facilities in the U.S. -- are helping mitigate geopolitical vulnerabilities while deepening relationships with key customers. For investors looking for an infrastructure-first way to participate in the AI revolution, it represents the ultimate pick-and-shovel opportunity. 2. Alphabet: Building a complete AI ecosystem Over the past several years, Alphabet has methodically constructed a vertically integrated AI ecosystem. At the infrastructure layer, Google Cloud's tensor processing units (TPUs) provide a powerful alternative to Nvidia's GPUs for both training and inference workloads. Layered on top of this hardware foundation are Alphabet's growing ambitions in quantum computing, anchored by its custom Willow chip. On the software side, the company has introduced Cirq, an open-source quantum programming framework that complements the company's hardware advances. Meanwhile, DeepMind, the company's in-house AI research lab, is helping push the frontiers of next-generation machine intelligence. Taken together, these assets position it at the intersection of classical computing and quantum AI. Crowning this ecosystem is Gemini, Alphabet's large language model (LLM), which competes directly with OpenAI's ChatGPT (via Microsoft Azure) and Anthropic's Claude (via Amazon Web Services). By combining infrastructure, research, and software under one roof, Alphabet has quietly built one of the most diversified and formidable AI suites in the world. The next AI winners might already be hiding in plain sight While Nvidia will likely remain a cornerstone of the AI narrative, investors seeking durable, long-term growth may find greater opportunity in companies that enable and scale up AI rather than those centering on a single product line. TSMC stands to benefit from continuous chip upgrade cycles regardless of which company's designs are in demand, while Alphabet is embedding AI into every layer of its business: search, advertising, streaming, Android, cybersecurity, cloud computing, and autonomous systems. In many ways, Taiwan Semi and Alphabet represent two sides of the same coin: One company powers the physical infrastructure of the AI era, while the other drives its digital intelligence. By the end of this decade, both TSMC and Alphabet could quietly -- yet decisively -- outperform Nvidia, reminding investors that the true winners of technological revolutions are rarely those that perfect a single product category, but rather the ecosystems and enablers that make these products and services a crucial feature of everyday life."

The stock has advanced a mind-boggling 29,000%. That happened as the company got in on the artificial intelligence (AI) story in its earliest days, allowing it to tailor its chips to suit AI needs and take considerable market share. It's likely that Nvidia, as the leading AI chip designer, will continue to gain in the next chapters of the AI boom -- but it may not be the biggest growth story. Instead, this underrated AI infrastructure player could outperform Nvidia over the next decade. An Nvidia customer This company, like its AI infrastructure rivals, is a customer of Nvidia, offering the chip designer's top performing graphics processing units (GPUs) as part of its selection of AI offerings. I'm talking about Alphabet (GOOG 0.86%) (GOOGL 0.82%), a company you might more easily associate with Internet search thanks to its Google Search business than with AI -- that's why I consider it an ""underrated"" AI stock. Year after year, Google Search has maintained more than 90% market share, and you may rely on the Google platform daily as soon as you sit down at your computer or turn on your phone. So, it's no surprise that Google, through advertising across the platform, generates most of the company's revenue -- in the latest quarter, Google advertising brought in $71 billion, which represents more than 70% of total sales. And this business is likely to continue growing as Alphabet uses AI to improve search results as well as the effectiveness of advertisers' ads. This should keep both search users and advertisers loyal -- and may even lead to increases in ad spending. But where Alphabet may see tremendous growth in the coming years is in its Google Cloud business, an area where its AI strengths can shine. The company has already developed its own large language model (LLM), Gemini, which not only is powering the AI used in the search business, but also is a key tool offered to customers of the cloud unit. A variety of AI products and services In fact, Google Cloud not only features Gemini, but also a variety of other AI products and services needed by customers. And right now, we're entering a key phase of the AI revolution -- the quest for AI capacity. Customers are rushing to infrastructure companies so that they can run their AI workloads, and companies like Alphabet are seeing this reflected in their revenue growth. In the latest quarter, Google Cloud revenue increased 32% to more than $13 billion thanks to demand for AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions. The company said deals worth more than $250 million doubled year over year, and in the first half, Google Cloud signed the same number of deals worth more than $1 billion as it did in all of last year. And this follows quarter after quarter of growth in the business, with revenue and operating income reaching milestones -- such as $10 billion and $1 billion, respectively, in the second quarter of last year. Jensen Huang's prediction Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts that AI infrastructure spending may reach as much as $4 trillion by the end of this decade, which sets the stage for a growing infrastructure company like Alphabet to excel. On top of this, an element that's weighed on Alphabet stock has recently lifted. In a U.S. antitrust case against the company, the worst-case scenario didn't unfold: A judge ruled that Alphabet wouldn't be required to dismantle its Google business. With this risk behind it, Alphabet now may attract certain cautious stock investors that were waiting for the outcome of that case. Now, we know that Nvidia and Alphabet both are well positioned to benefit from AI growth in the years to come -- why could Alphabet actually outperform? Today, Alphabet stock is considerably cheaper than Nvidia -- at 24x forward earnings estimates versus 41x. Alphabet's price offers investors a bargain entry point and suggests this player has plenty of room to run, especially considering the need for AI infrastructure in the years to come. All this means Alphabet may have what it takes to outperform market giant Nvidia over the next decade."

In fact, they're the two cheapest of the Magnificent Seven and represent screaming buys today. Let's zoom in for a closer look. 1. Alphabet Alphabet is most known for its Google Search platform, since most of us use it every day. Google Search has dominated the market for years, steadily holding about 90% share, and that's likely to continue thanks to Alphabet's focus on AI. The company is using this technology to make search better than ever -- and improve the advertising experience for advertisers. This is key because advertising makes up most of the company's revenue, so making these customers happy should keep them coming back and spending more. On top of this, Alphabet also operates another growth business, and that's Google Cloud. This unit has delivered quarter after quarter of double-digit growth, and in the recent period, revenue topped $13 billion. Growth potential is big because Google Cloud is well positioned to benefit from AI demand -- Alphabet has developed its own large language model (LLM) and is using it to power various products and services available through its cloud unit. And Google Cloud also offers access to a variety of other top AI products, such as Nvidia's high-performance AI chips. Another reason to be bullish on Alphabet is a recent court ruling in a U.S. antitrust case against the company eliminated the worst-case scenario -- a possible breakup of Google -- so Alphabet remains on track for growth. All of this makes the stock look dirt cheap at only 21x forward earnings estimates. 2. Meta Platforms Meta Platforms' big business is social media as it owns the world's most recognizable and popular apps -- Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram. In fact, 3.4 billion people use at least one of those apps on a daily basis. But Meta isn't just a social media company and is instead building itself into an AI giant. The company has created its own LLM and has kept some of its AI work open source, a move that could help Meta stand out as a leader as AI develops. This tech giant is using its AI strengths to keep users on its apps longer, thanks to its AI assistant, and to help advertisers, its main source of revenue, improve their campaigns. The company also aims to grow through the development and sales of AI devices, such as its AI glasses. Meta already has increased earnings into the billions of dollars over time, and in the recent quarter, announced double-digit gains in revenue and net income -- sales reached $47 billion, while net income rose to $18 billion. All of this along with a cash position of $47 billion mean the company has what it takes to pursue this AI investment and potentially win. Meanwhile, the company also is sharing the wealth with shareholders through and dividends -- Meta paid out $1.33 billion in dividends in the recent quarter. Today, Meta stock trades for 25x forward earnings estimates, making it the second-cheapest of the Magnificent Seven after Alphabet and a screaming buy, considering its performance so far and its ability to stand out in the AI revolution."

Shares of D-Wave Quantum (NYSE: QBTS) jumped on Thursday, finishing up 14%. The spike comes as the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) was flat and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) gained 0.4%. The quantum computing stock is moving along with the rest of the quantum market after Rigetti Computing announced it sold two of its Novera quantum computing systems. The news is a big win for the company, as the combined $5.7 million value of the orders represents more than half of the company's entire top line in 2024. It was taken as a bullish sign for quantum in general, helping to lift D-Wave stock as well. D-Wave's own announcement earlier this week is also driving shares higher. The company said it worked with the North Wales Police Department ""to optimize placement of police vehicles for emergency response"" in a joint test of its technology. D-Wave says that it was able to reduce average response times by 50%, demonstrating the ""real-world potential across private and public sectors"" of its technology. Remain cautious The potential of quantum is enormous, but the technology is earlier in its development than investors believe it to be, and what I think many of these companies are hoping for. D-Wave's press release is noticeably light on critical details like how much of its ""hybrid-quantum solver"" is quantum and how much is classical. D-Wave's $10 billion market cap is hard to justify, with sales last year of just $8.8 million. I would look to Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) for a better quantum play.

Yet two Wall Street bulls with social-media megaphones are doing both, just as many stock pickers are watching their clients walk away. ETFs launched separately by veteran strategist Tom Lee and longtime tech bull Dan Ives have found success by betting big on the technology stocks benefiting from the AI boom, all while leveraging their founders’ personal brands to attract investors. Along the way, they have engineered a rare double act: outperformance and inflows. So far, that approach is working. Lee, who broadcasts to more than half a million followers on X and is the co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, has seen his Granny Shots US Large Cap ETF (ticker GRNY) pull in roughly $2.5 billion in less than 12 months. Ives’s eponymous Wedbush AI Revolution ETF (IVES), meanwhile, has shot to around $750 million in assets since its June debut. Both funds are handily beating the S&P 500 Index this year, with GRNY up 23% and IVES 25%. “I wanted a way for investors around the world, retail and institutional, to invest in the AI theme,” said Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities known for bold calls and a colorful wardrobe. In a world of ultra-complicated ETFs, he said he wanted a fund simple enough “that someone in junior high school could understand what we’re doing.” Going all-in has its pitfalls. Valuations in tech stocks have grown stretched, leaving concentrated bets vulnerable to a pullback. Investors in hot ETFs can also be fickle, quick to pile in when markets are surging and just as ready to abandon ship if the tide turns. Cathie Wood’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) serves as an example: the fund tumbled nearly 70% when investors abandoned bets on pandemic-era darlings in 2022 and is still seeing outflows, despite a 44% rally this year. And of course, both Lee and Ives have stumbled in the past. In February, Lee urged investors to buy a tariff-fueled dip in stocks that turned out to be the prelude to a far worse selloff, a call for which he publicly apologized months later. Ives, a long-time Tesla bull, has wavered on the EV-maker. He cut his target on Tesla nearly in half in April, just before the stock began to rebound from its lows of the year, only to reverse course later and declare that the company has entered a “golden age.” Still, the bull market has made it easier to shrug off risks, as the relentless grind higher in stocks punishes investors sitting on the sidelines. Lee and Ives have both benefited from that climate, using their social media bullhorns to bypass the gatekeepers active managers typically depend on — broker-dealer platforms, consultants, retirement plans — and appeal directly to potential clients. Many of Lee’s followers are retail traders. who treat his daily posts as investable signals. Ives, long a fixture on television as a tech bull, taps a similar dynamic. “The bears are in hibernation mode,” said Ives. “They missed transformational tech over the last 20 years because they were waiting for some black swan event and just focused on valuations and spreadsheets.” Active vs Passive By contrast, it’s been a year of missed chances for many of Wall Street’s active managers. Barely a third of active funds are beating the S&P 500, according to Athanasios Psarofagis of Bloomberg Intelligence, and fewer still are attracting new assets. Investors — fatigued by high fees and years of underperformance — continue piling into passive trackers, such as those linked to the S&P 500. Part of the reason for those lackluster results is active managers’ tendency to underweight tech stocks in a bid to diversify their portfolios — a strategy that can help take the edge off downturns but also hurts performance in tech-driven bull markets. Lee and Ives have gone the other way. Their funds both have Tesla Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Oracle Corp. as their top names, with the stocks up 5%, 30% and 75% year to date, respectively. The rest of their portfolios are also largely oriented on tech and AI, though only a quarter of the two funds’ holdings overlap, according to data from the ETF Research Center. “We seek to identify both the long-term themes we see shaping the economy and stock market over the next 5-10 years, as well as the short-term themes that capture tactical market shifts,” said Ken Xuan, co-portfolio manager of GRNY. The payoff has been immediate: Lee’s GRNY — whose name is derived from an unconventional basketball free-throw style he likens to his systematic, theme-based stock-picking process — has seen inflows every month since launch, bar one. Ives’ ETF has not seen a weekly outflow since it launched. “If you haven’t been leaning hard into mega-cap and AI leaders, you’ve been left behind,” said Dave Mazza, chief executive officer of Roundhill Investments. “The managers who’ve done best are the ones willing to run old-school, high conviction, concentrated portfolios, while those hugging the benchmark or shying away from AI over valuation concerns have ended up missing the rally entirely.” Other boutique players have also managed to outperform. Take the Strategas Macro Thematic Opportunities ETF (SAMT), run by strategist Ryan Grabinski. Launched in 2022, the actively-managed fund focuses on five themes, including AI, industrial power and deglobalization. It holds some 40 stocks rebalanced roughly every month and is up 26% year to date. More broadly, AI-related stocks are up 40% in the past year, by one measure. While some might find it hard to jump in on the heels of such a run, Ives believes the trade still has another “three to four years” left to go. AI “is the most exciting tech theme in the last 40, 50 years,” he said. “I feel like it’s 10:30 p.m. in a party that goes until 4:00 a.m.” —With assistance from Vildana Hajric and Matt Turner."

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the 15 Best American Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now. On September 22, Baird increased its price target on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) from $215 to $275 while keeping an Outperform rating. Baird highlighted that Google continues to dominate in the search market, even though generative AI platforms are growing. The research firm’s analysis suggests that Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google controls the majority of commercial search queries. AI search makes up only about 1% of total referral traffic and an “immaterial percentage” of conversions. Baird pointed out that AI chatbots seem to be growing the total addressable market for search instead of taking customers away from Google’s business. This creates a positive outlook for Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google. The research firm also noted that Google’s AI Overview (AIO) focuses more on informational queries rather than commercial intent. This can help reduce potential negative impacts on the company’s advertising revenue. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a global technology company and the parent company of Google. The company’s products include Search, Ads, Chrome, Cloud, YouTube, and Android.

That's when a Federal judge ruled Alphabet wouldn't have to divest key assets as part of its antitrust decision, could continue paying distributors to pre-load its Search engine onto phones and other devices, and could retain some types of data it collects on its platforms for itself. The sigh of relief over the better-than-feared ruling sent Alphabet shares up nearly 20% thus far in September and a solid 34% on the year, sending the company's market cap over $3 trillion. But who's to say Alphabet can't double again? After all, the Search juggernaut was the cheapest Magnificent Seven stock to start the year. And even after its strong run, its stock only trades at 25 times earnings, which isn't that expensive compared to other AI darlings. Speaking of generative AI, here's how this exciting new technology can boost Alphabet's value to $6 trillion by the end of the decade. Gemini improves Alphabet's existing assets The advent of the AI wars has spurred Alphabet to move faster. After the initial shock release of ChatGPT in late 2022, Alphabet hunkered down, streamlined its workforce, and is now innovating at a very fast pace. In 2024, Google added AI Overviews to Search, which have done a good job of keeping daily habit Google Search users from leaving Google as their first destination when seeking information. Then earlier this year, Google unveiled ""AI Mode"" which uses Google's Gemini large language model to give a chatbot-like experience within the Search interface. Investors should expect more innovation within Search and other existing Alphabet assets, especially as Alphabet infuses Gemini into more products. What's especially bullish about that is that the Gemini 2.5 model appears to be best-in-class in the industry today, even against rival OpenAI. When it was released five months ago, Gemini 2.5 quickly shot up to the top of SimpleBench and LMArena, two independent LLM scoring sites. In computer coding, Gemini just took the Gold Medal at the recent 2025 International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) World Finals. And since Google released Nano Banana, a leading image generation tool derived from Gemini 2.5, the Gemini app shot up to number on the App store for the first time on September 12. And speaking of the court decision on Chrome, Alphabet is now looking to infuse its Chrome browser with Gemini features and agentic capabilities. Soon, users will be able to summarize complex information on a web page, refer back to an old web page one has visited in the past, have Gemini shop for groceries, book trips, or answer questions in AI mode all within the scope of the browser. Just as Search is a daily habit for billions, Chrome is also a huge distribution asset for Alphabet. While Google accounts for about 90% of the Search industry, Chrome has nearly 70% of the global browser market, with a huge lead over second-place Safari. That makes Chrome a powerful distribution asset, whereby Alphabet can expose a massive user base to its now best-in-class AI tools. Google Cloud Even if Alphabet's own AI efforts don't win in the market, Alphabet is still exposed to revolutionary AI research through its cloud division. Alphabet has carved out a solid position as the third-largest cloud infrastructure, with a platform especially compelling for AI start-ups. Google Cloud customers include an illustrious who's who of AI research, including former founders of OpenAI and Google DeepMind. That helped the unit accelerate growth 31.7% last quarter, with operating profits inflecting 141% off of a low number. Google Cloud just reached profitability in 2023, and is now on a near-$12 billion operating profit run-rate. Moreover, just over 50% of new revenue over the past year has fallen to the cloud unit's bottom line. Assuming Google Cloud reaches $60 billion in revenue and $12 billion in operating profit this year, and that the unit can grow at a 20% compound annual rate through 2030 with just 40% incremental profits instead of 50%, by 2030 Google Cloud will be making $150 billion in revenue and $50 billion in operating profit. In this investor's mind, that would put the value of Google Cloud alone at $1 trillion to $2 trillion by then, all by itself. Waymo Finally, self-driving robotaxis have gone from science experiment to reality, with Alphabet's Waymo being the first-mover by a wide margin. Waymo is already operating at scale in Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Atlanta, and Austin. Later this year, Waymo will begin testing in winter climates in Denver and Seattle. Waymo is also targeting a 2026 opening in Nashville, and has Miami, Washington D.C., and Dallas in its sites in the near future. In a smart move, Waymo is expanding aggressively, looking to take mindshare before Tesla (TSLA 2.58%) or any other would-be competitor can get a foothold. To drive adoption, Waymo is partnering with demand aggregators Uber, Lyft, and public transportation aggregator Via Transportation to grow demand as quickly as possible. With trust such an important factor in autonomous mobility, establishing itself as a safe alternative should yield tremendous benefits for Waymo in the future. According to Goldman Sachs the autonomous robotaxi market is expected to grow at a 90% annualized rate through 2030. And while that would only put the autonomous rideshare industry at a $7.5 billion revenue run-rate in the United States by then, Goldman notes that is just the beginning. By 2040, Goldman estimates autonomous ridesharing will be cheaper than owning a car. And the business is expected to profitable too, with Goldman estimating vertically integrated autonomous vehicle companies garnering 40% to 50% gross margins. All in all, Waymo could become another important multi-billion profit business for Alphabet in the 2030s, driving further growth and value. Combining Waymo with its other established profit centers, Alphabet seems set to become a veritable AI conglomerate in 2030, adding diversification and likely a valuation expansion by that time."

With 2 billion users and one of the best enterprise cloud services available, Alphabet is well-positioned to help investors outperform the market. How Google is benefiting from AI Earlier in the year, some investors were concerned about Google's competitive position as more people started using ChatGPT and other models to look up information. This overlooked the power of Google's Gemini AI model, which has emerged as one of the best models out there. Gemini powers all the company's consumer services, like Search, and it is making a difference in the company's financial performance. Revenue from Search -- the company's largest business -- grew 12% year over year in the second quarter. This momentum reflects increasing search queries with AI Overviews. Google is also competitively positioned in cloud services. The number of new customers using Google Cloud jumped 28% quarter over quarter in Q2. Management credits this momentum to its global base of AI-optimized data centers, custom AI chips, storage, and software offerings. It can't be emphasized enough that Google's AI capabilities are only possible because of the company's substantial free cash flow. It generated $67 billion in free cash flow over the last year, while spending $67 billion in capital expenditures for technology and AI infrastructure. Google has the resources to deliver the best AI experiences for its users, yet Alphabet stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 25.

Software development is one of them. For example, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and its parent, Alphabet (GOOG 0.86%) (GOOGL 0.82%), said earlier this year that over 30% of Google's code had been generated by AI. Cathie Wood and her team at Ark Invest think that we're only in the early stages of AI software development. Wood predicts that the AI software market will reach $13 trillion by 2030. I think one stock will be unstoppable if she's right. One stock stands above the rest Actually, I suspect that several stocks will be unstoppable if the AI software market grows to $13 trillion over the next five years. Since I've already mentioned Alphabet, I'll start with it. The company's Google Gemini Code Assist helps with creating software code and debugging with multiple programming languages. Google DeepThink would have won second place in the 2025 International Collegiate Programming Competition if large language models (LLMs) were allowed to win. OpenAI's GPT-5 would have taken first place. Datadog (DDOG 1.23%) is another stock that I believe will be a huge winner if the AI software market explodes. The company's technology helps customers monitor their cloud applications and infrastructure. Since most AI software runs in the cloud, Datadog should be an obvious beneficiary if Wood's market prediction comes true. However, I think one stock stands above the rest in profiting from a massive AI software market: Nvidia (NVDA 0.86%). Sure, Nvidia already ranks as the largest company in the world based on market cap. But if Wood is right, it's going to grow much bigger over the next few years. The center of the AI universe It's no exaggeration to say that Nvidia stands at the center of the AI universe. The company's GPUs remain the best at powering AI models. I don't expect Nvidia to be knocked off its perch anytime soon. Yes, several others have developed chips that can be used in AI training and inference. However, none of them has been able to keep up with Nvidia. There's a reason why the company's newest Blackwell GPUs are practically flying off the shelves. More importantly, Nvidia isn't slowing down its pace of innovation. The company recently announced its new Rubin CPX GPU that supports massive-context inference. This chip will enable AI models to process millions of tokens. Rubin CPX will almost certainly be a significant milestone for video creation using generative AI. But I believe Nvidia's new GPU could be a game-changer for AI software development. Why? To support full-blown software development, AI models have to process and understand entire codebases. Today's infrastructure simply doesn't have the capacity to handle such massive context. Rubin CPX should enable AI to morph from simple coding assistance to advanced tools that can tackle large-scale software projects. Granted, this new CPU won't be available until late next year. However, I fully expect that Nvidia won't just be at the center of the AI universe; it will be at the center of the AI software universe, too. Will the AI software market really hit $13 trillion? Wood and Ark Invest are significantly more bullish about how much the AI software market will grow over the next five years than most industry observers. For example, ABI Research projects the market will reach $467 billion by 2030. While that reflects a compound annual growth rate of around 25%, it's far short of $13 trillion. Ark Invest's prediction assumes ""rapid mass adoption"" of AI in creating software, with ""81% of current working time automated by 2030."" That might be too optimistic, but I don't think it's out of the question. Still, I'm not sure if the AI software market will really hit $13 trillion in only five years. Even if it doesn't, I don't doubt that AI will play a much more important role in software development by then than it does now. And I'm confident that Nvidia will be unstoppable regardless of what the AI software market size is by the end of the decade."

That is why it can sometimes be smart to make note of the moves these investors are making to see if you might want to do the same. Let's look at five artificial intelligence (AI) stocks that billionaires were buying in Q2 and see if they might help you in your efforts to boost your portfolio. Philippe Laffont: Nvidia and Broadcom Philippe Laffont runs Coatue Management, which is a technology-focused hedge fund. While he may not be a household name, Laffont manages money for rich and powerful clients, including Amazon (AMZN -0.61%) founder Jeff Bezos. Public filings show the billionaire was buying two top AI chip stocks in Q2, adding to his positions in Nvidia (NVDA 0.86%) and Broadcom (AVGO -1.24%). He increased his Nvidia stake by 34% and those shares now account for 5% of his overall portfolio. He upped his Broadcom position by 58%, and it now represents 4.3% of his holdings. With Nvidia predicting that AI infrastructure spending could climb from $600 billion to as much as $4 trillion by the end of the decade, it's easy to see why Laffont is bullish on AI chip stocks. Nvidia is obviously the undisputed leader and has been the biggest beneficiary of the race to build out new AI data centers. Given the wide moat it's created through its CUDA software platform, the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are likely to remain the primary chips powering AI workloads long into the future. However, Broadcom is also becoming a major player in the space by helping customers design custom AI chips. As good as Nvidia's chips are, customers do not want to solely rely on the chip giant, and those with deep pockets that are building massive data centers have been increasingly turning to Broadcom. While custom chips lack the flexibility of GPUs, they often can have higher performance and cost savings for the specific task for which they've been designed. With AI chip demand surging, both Nvidia and Broadcom look like they will be long-term winners. Stanley Druckenmiller: TSMC Stanley Druckenmiller manages the Duquesne Family Office. This basically means that Druckenmiller became so rich that he no longer needs to manage the money of outside investors and is happy just investing his own money. Druckenmiller was also investing in the AI chip theme, but instead of buying shares in chip designers, he added to his position in the company that manufactures the advanced chips: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -1.59%). Druckenmiller boosted his position by 28%, taking it up to a 4.3% position in his portfolio. The beauty of investing in TSMC is that Druckenmiller doesn't have to pick a chip winner. TSMC is currently the only foundry that is able to make advanced chips with a high yield rate (this means with only a few defective chips per wafer) at scale. That has made it a close partner to every chipmaker and given it strong pricing power. With the need for AI chips growing and potential in emerging industries like robotaxis and quantum computing, TSMC looks like a long-term winner. Bill Ackman: Amazon and Alphabet Famed investor Bill Ackman is head of Pershing Square Capital Management. Ackman has always been fond of the consumer space, and he's playing AI in much the same way, making a large investment in Amazon in the quarter and increasing his bet on Alphabet (GOOGL 0.82%) (GOOG 0.86%). Amazon was a new investment for Ackman, and it represents a little over 9% of his portfolio, while he boosted his position in Alphabet so it now accounts for 15% of his holdings. Both Amazon and Alphabet are cloud computing leaders that are seeing huge demand for their services. They also both have their own custom AI chips, which can help improve performance and reduce costs. This space is booming, and both are investing aggressively to take advantage of the opportunity. Meanwhile, both companies are also deploying AI to help power their core businesses. Amazon is using AI to make its e-commerce business more efficient. This includes everything from having AI-powered robots in its fulfillment centers to using AI to optimize delivery routes and improve supply chain management. It's also using AI to drive its fast-growing sponsored ad business. This is all leading to strong operating leverage in its retail operations. Alphabet, on the other hand, is using AI to help power its search business. AI Overviews is leading to more search queries, and it's just started rolling out its new AI Mode globally. In addition, newer features such as Lens and Circle to Search are also driving more queries, with many having a commercial intent (this is when a user is searching for products or services to purchase). With a big distribution advantage through its Chrome browser and Android operating system and a huge global ad network, Alphabet is well-positioned to benefit from AI. Overall, both Amazon and Alphabet look like long-term AI winners."

In yesterday’s trading session, Wall Street’s main stock indexes closed higher, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 notching new record highs. Seagate Technology (STX) climbed over +7% and was the top percentage gainer on the S&P 500 after Bank of America raised its price target on the stock to $215 from $170. Also, Alphabet (GOOGL) gained more than +4% after Citi raised its price target on the stock to $280 from $225. In addition, Tesla (TSLA) rose over +3% after CEO Elon Musk bought about $1 billion worth of the EV maker’s shares. On the bearish side, Corteva (CTVA) slumped more than -5% and was the top percentage loser on the S&P 500 after several analysts questioned the merits of a potential breakup of the agriculture company’s seed and pesticide businesses. Economic data released on Monday showed that the Empire State manufacturing index fell to a 3-month low of -8.70 in September, weaker than expectations of 4.30. The Fed kicks off its two-day meeting later in the day. The central bank is widely expected to cut the Fed funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 4.00% to 4.25% on Wednesday. Investors will be watching Chair Jerome Powell’s post-policy meeting press conference for any indications on how quickly rates may fall from here. Following recent data painting a picture of a slowing labor market, U.S. money markets have almost fully priced in follow-up rate cuts in October and December. Market watchers will also closely parse the Fed’s quarterly “dot plot” in its Summary of Economic Projections, which will offer key guidance on how policymakers expect the interest-rate path to unfold over the next few years. “Now the discussion will turn to how aggressively the Fed will act. The Fed may remind everyone that it may be focused on jobs now, but it hasn’t forgotten about the other half of its mandate,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. In other Fed news, a federal appeals court ruled on Monday that Fed Governor Lisa Cook can continue serving at the central bank while her legal case proceeds, upholding a lower court’s decision. Also, President Trump’s economic adviser Stephen Miran is set to join the Fed’s board after the Senate confirmed him to the post on Monday night. On the economic data front, all eyes are focused on U.S. Retail Sales data, which is set to be released in a couple of hours. Economists, on average, forecast that Retail Sales will show a +0.2% m/m increase in August following a +0.5% m/m climb in July. Investors will also focus on U.S. Core Retail Sales data, which rose +0.3% m/m in July. Economists expect the August figure to climb +0.4% m/m. U.S. Industrial Production and Manufacturing Production data will be released today. Economists expect Industrial Production to drop -0.1% m/m and Manufacturing Production to be unchanged m/m in August, compared to the July figures of -0.1% m/m and no change m/m, respectively. U.S. Export and Import Price Indexes will be released today as well. Economists anticipate the export price index to drop -0.1% m/m and the import price index to fall -0.2% m/m in August, compared to the previous figures of +0.1% m/m and +0.4% m/m, respectively. In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note is at 4.040%, up +0.12%. The Euro Stoxx 50 Index is up +0.02% this morning, taking a breather after three sessions of gains, while investors digest a slew of economic data from the region and await the Fed’s monetary policy verdict on Wednesday. Luxury and mining stocks climbed on Tuesday. At the same time, bank and insurance stocks underperformed. Data from the Office for National Statistics released on Tuesday showed that the U.K.’s unemployment rate was unchanged in the three months to July as pay growth eased slightly, likely keeping the Bank of England on track to leave its key interest rate unchanged at this week’s meeting. Separately, final data from the statistics agency Istat confirmed that Italy’s annual inflation rate eased to 1.6% in August from 1.7% in July. In addition, the ZEW economic research institute reported that German investor morale unexpectedly rose in September, signaling cautious optimism about the economy. Meanwhile, France’s central bank cut its economic outlook for the next two years by 0.1 percentage point, cautioning about downside risks from budget uncertainty after another government collapse. In other news, senior U.S. officials said on Monday that President Donald Trump expects to announce economic deals worth more than $10 billion during his trip this week to the United Kingdom. In corporate news, Sthree Plc (STEM.LN) tumbled over -20% after the employment service provider issued a profit warning. U.K. Average Earnings ex Bonus, U.K. Unemployment Rate, Italy’s CPI, Germany’s ZEW Economic Sentiment Index, Eurozone’s ZEW Economic Sentiment Index, Eurozone’s Industrial Production, and Eurozone’s Labor Cost Index were released today. U.K. Average Earnings ex Bonus stood at 4.8% in the three months to July, in line with expectations. The U.K. Unemployment Rate was 4.7% in the three months to July, in line with expectations. The Italian August CPI rose +0.1% m/m and +1.6% y/y, in line with expectations. The German September ZEW Economic Sentiment Index came in at 37.3, stronger than expectations of 25.3. The Eurozone September ZEW Economic Sentiment Index stood at 26.1, stronger than expectations of 20.3.

China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed up +0.04%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed up +0.30%. China’s Shanghai Composite Index closed just above the flatline today as cautious sentiment prevailed, with investors weighing uncertainties surrounding U.S.-China trade talks. Strength in technology stocks lent support to the overall market on Tuesday. However, rare-earth, financial, and consumer stocks retreated. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he would speak with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Friday after U.S. and Chinese officials reached a framework agreement in Madrid to keep the TikTok app operating in the U.S. The two sides “reached a basic framework consensus on properly resolving TikTok-related matters through cooperation, reducing investment barriers and promoting relevant economic and trade cooperation”, according to Chinese state-owned Xinhua News Agency. At the same time, China increased the pressure on Washington during sensitive trade negotiations, with the country’s market regulator stating on Monday that Nvidia breached anti-monopoly laws with a high-profile 2020 deal. Also, China launched an anti-dumping investigation into some U.S.-made analog chips over the weekend. Nanhua Futures analysts said in a note that “stock indexes are likely to remain range-bound in the short term” as markets focus on U.S.-China trade talks and the Fed’s meeting later this week. Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index closed higher and hit a new record high today, tracking overnight gains on Wall Street. Automobile stocks outperformed on Tuesday, buoyed by the formal implementation of a lower 15% U.S. tariff rate on imports of automobiles and auto parts from Japan. Chip stocks also advanced. The Cabinet Office said on Tuesday that Japan’s output gap for the second quarter was revised upward to 0.3%, its highest level since July-September 2019, reflecting revised GDP data. Meanwhile, the yen strengthened against the dollar on Tuesday, partly supported by the entry of Japan’s Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi into the ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s leadership race. Koizumi is expected to favor continued policy tightening by the Bank of Japan and oppose a consumption tax cut, according to CBA’s Carol Kong. Investor focus this week is on the BOJ’s policy decision, where the central bank is expected to keep its short-term policy rate unchanged at 0.5%. Investors will be parsing whether Governor Kazuo Ueda hints at the possibility of future rate hikes as growth remains steady and inflation stays elevated. The Nikkei Volatility Index, which takes into account the implied volatility of Nikkei 225 options, closed down -1.27% to 24.13.

Too often, would-be investors sit on the sidelines, waiting to accumulate what they perceive is ""enough"" capital before making their first move. The reality is that even a modest investment can provide ownership in some of the world's most influential businesses. With the right mindset and a commitment to long-term growth, a small stake today can become the foundation for meaningful wealth in the years ahead. With that in mind, here are six artificial intelligence (AI) stocks you can begin building a position in with just $1,000. The hardware backbones AI development is inseparable from infrastructure. As demand for compute and inference continues to accelerate, investors should focus on the companies supplying the hardware backbone that makes this growth possible. At the top of this list is Nvidia (NVDA 0.86%), the undisputed leader in AI infrastructure. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) remain the gold standard for training AI workloads, while its CUDA software architecture helps form a deep competitive moat -- making it both costly and complex for developers to switch providers. In practice, rising capital expenditures (capex) from hyperscalers flow directly back to Nvidia. This creates a lucrative feedback loop: More investment in AI infrastructure drives ongoing demand for Nvidia's chips, which in turn fuels the next wave of applications beyond today's large language models (LLMs). Nebius Group is emerging as a notable player in the evolving cloud infrastructure landscape. The company's business model centers on renting GPUs through a specialized platform designed to help enterprises manage AI workloads with greater efficiency and flexibility. Positioned as both cost-effective and technologically capable, Nebius is carving out a niche in infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) beyond incumbents like CoreWeave. Nebius benefits from strong ties to Nvidia and recently secured a $17.4 billion partnership with Microsoft. The silent giant enabling the GPU ecosystem is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. While designers like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices capture outsize attention, it's TSMC's foundry that brings their chips to life -- producing semiconductors at the most advanced nodes available. As emerging AI applications in robotics and autonomous systems demand increasingly sophisticated fabrication processes, TSMC's deep footprint in cutting-edge manufacturing is set to expand. The software superstar Once dismissed as a niche government contractor, Palantir Technologies (PLTR 0.11%) has transformed into one of the most formidable players in the software arena. Throughout the AI revolution, the company has gone toe to toe with enterprise incumbents like Salesforce and SAP, carving out market share across the private sector and proving its platform is indispensable. What truly differentiates Palantir is the trust it commands at the highest level. While smaller rivals such as C3.ai and BigBear.ai are left chasing deals that are narrow in scope, Palantir is securing $10 billion contracts with the U.S. Army and forging strategic alliances with NATO. Even more telling is how tech titans like Amazon, Microsoft, and Oracle have opted to partner with Palantir rather than compete head-on. This alignment opened new doors in healthcare, energy, and financial services -- where Palantir is winning sticky, long-term contracts that provide durable revenue visibility and expanding unit economics. In short, Palantir has evolved into a cornerstone of the AI software landscape -- positioned to scale alongside the public and private sectors as AI investments continue to move downstream. A magnificent duo While infrastructure and software tend to dominate the headlines, two consumer-facing giants -- Alphabet (GOOG 0.86%) (GOOGL 0.82%) and Meta Platforms (META 0.82%) -- remain underappreciated relative to their ""Magnificent Seven"" peers. Alphabet's strength lies in the breadth and integration of its ecosystem. Advertising remains a cash cow fueled by dominance in search (Google) and engagement (YouTube). Yet beneath the surface, Alphabet has quietly built a vertically integrated AI empire: Custom Tensor Processing units (TPU) that rival with Nvidia's GPUs, a rapidly expanding cloud computing platform, and DeepMind -- Alphabet's internal research lab driving breakthroughs that flow right into commercially available products. Meanwhile, Meta commands arguably the most valuable social media network on the planet. With billions of users across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, the company is not only monetizing attention through advertising, but also unlocking new avenues of growth through AI-powered personalization. Few companies can deploy new features so broadly and effectively at scale -- positioning Meta as a winner in the next phase of AI's digital transformation."

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly. Top 5 Upgrades: - Vertical Research upgraded Boeing (BA) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $270, up from $242. With the aerospace upcycle intact but shifting into ""a mid-cycle environment,"" Vertical sees room to take a ""more balanced aero aftermarket vs OEM stance."" - Oppenheimer analyst Suraj Kalia upgraded Boston Scientific (BSX) to Outperform from Perform with a price target of $125, up from $118, after assuming coverage of the name. The firm believes Boston Scientific offers one of the best large-cap growth stories in medical technology, driven by a ""disciplined"" acquisition strategy and strong execution. - Mizuho upgraded Chewy (CHWY) to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $50, up from $44. The stock's risk/reward is ""titled heavily upwards"" following the recent selloff, the firm tells investors in a research note. - JPMorgan upgraded Veeva (VEEV) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $330, up from $290. The firm says the company is only 14% penetrated in a $20B-plus life Sciences industry opportunity, which has historically grown mid-single digits. Veeva will grow revenue at 13% annually and post cash flow margins of 40%-plus over the next three years, supported by a ""competitively differentiated"" platform-approach and total addressable market penetration opportunity, the firm tells investors in a research note. - TD Cowen upgraded Canada Goose (GOOS) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $18, up from $16. The firm cites the company's move from classic to a year-round lifestyle outerwear product for the upgrade. Top 5 Downgrades: - Phillip Securities downgraded Alphabet (GOOGL) to Accumulate from Buy with a price target of $265, up from $235. The firm views the U.S. district judge ruling positively and believes restrictions on exclusivity will have limited impacts on Google's product strength and partner incentives, but cites valuation for the downgrade following the stock's recent rally. - RBC Capital downgraded TransDigm (TDG) to Sector Perform from Outperform with a price target of $1,385, down from $1,550. The firm sees a continued period of uncertainty for the stock. - JPMorgan downgraded SAIC (SAIC) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $115, down from $140. The company's revenue outlook has weakened in recent months, and its pivot is proving more challenging than expected under the Trump administration, the firm tells investors in a research note. - Baird downgraded ABM (ABM) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $54, down from $56. The company's fiscal Q3 results showed it is adjusting prices to hold off competition in several large markets where weak demands persists, the firm notes, adding that it believes this could take time to rectify and warrants a reversal of the positive share thesis. - D. Boral Capital downgraded Artelo Biosciences (ARTL) to Hold from Buy and removed the firm's prior price target following the company's ""unexpected"" $3M capital raise last week that came after what appeared to be an unsuccessful crypto-related strategy."

""This trade is very nonlinear and volatile in nature,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. The AI market is still developing, moving through distinct phases that have each presented unique investment opportunities and risks, Sheridan added. The first phase focused heavily on infrastructure — building out data centers, cloud networks, and powerful chips to support AI's rapid growth. But now the focus is moving toward the ""application layer,"" where companies are figuring out how to use AI in real-world products and services. The shift is critical because there are ""very different skews"" between how AI is being adopted by consumers versus businesses, per Sheridan. ""People are much more likely to adopt AI in their consumer computing habits than their enterprise computing habits,"" he explained, adding that consumers see less risk in AI and don't feel it will hurt their ability to earn money. However, the adoption of AI by large companies is riskier. ""Enterprises have to operate within strict budget requirements,"" Sheridan said. ""You also run into some friction on the employee side with respect to how they use AI in their own individual workflows."" These differences in adoption could affect the growth potential of AI stocks. While AI applications for consumers are advancing rapidly, businesses may take longer to integrate AI on a wide scale. In a note to clients, Goldman analyst Ryan Hammond wrote that the AI stock market suggests valuations may already be ahead of themselves. AI-exposed stocks rallied by 32% in 2024, though they remain below the levels seen during the tech bubble and 2021. Nonetheless, Hammond cautions that the eventual slowdown in hyperscaler capital expenditures could create risks for these stocks. ""Timing this inflection is challenging,"" he noted, adding that the next few quarters will be critical in determining whether AI-driven infrastructure companies can continue to deliver the growth investors are expecting. Meta (META) has remained bullish on the technology, with plans to invest $600 billion in the US through 2028 to develop AI infrastructure. Sheridan is cautious about the long-term financial impact, though he pointed out the company is already seeing results. Meta is among several digital platforms — including Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) and Pinterest (PINS) — that could benefit from AI disrupting traditional advertising."
08d56519cd45d3407db3e87549805f95596eb93fa8823a252e10b70303e39a63,GOOGL,Google Just Surged 9 %! Here are 2 Options Trades to Keep Riding the Rally,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-just-surged-9-2-072204620.html,finance.yahoo.com,20250905T134500Z,semi,0.65,"Alphabet soared 9% on Sept 3, 2025. In a statement that investors everywhere celebrated, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta - the same judge who ruled Google was illegally operating a monopoly last year - decided yesterday that the Department of Justice’s proposed penalties for the company were too harsh. The result? Google is no longer under threat of being broken up and forced to sell Chrome, which represents a significant part of what makes Google’s search and advertising businesses so successful. To be clear, the other penalties are still on the table, though. Google’s been ordered to share indexing and data with competitors to “level the playing field,” and the company’s now barred from exclusive contracts. But how should you play this? Obviously, the markets made their sentiment known - as you can see from the 5-day chart. With that out of the way, I see two strategies that you can use to capitalize on this potential bull run, each banking on upside price movement but offering different ways to earn money. So, let’s take a look at long calls and bull puts. Long Call Long calls are single-leg option strategies that function as a directional bet on an underlying asset. In this case, you want the stock price to increase. Buying a long call option gives you control of 100 shares of the stock, at a fraction of the price. Of course, the level of exposure isn’t the same as owning 100 shares of the stock, but if you’re willing to pay top dollar and firmly believe that Google isn’t done climbing yet, then you can get option contracts that reflect 80% or more of the underlying’s price movement. That’s called delta, the options Greek that indicates the relationship between the premium and the stock price movement. A delta of 80 means that the premiums are expected to increase 80 cents for every $1 increase in the underlying asset. The thing is, high-delta long calls are always in the money, which means their premiums will be higher. Let’s take a look at just how high, with GOOGL as the underlying asset. Finding An 80 Delta Long Call Trade The first thing you need to do is go to Barchart.com and search for Alphabet. Once on the stock’s profile page, go to the left-hand navigation panel and click Long Call/Put. You’ll be brought straight to the results page, where you’ll see suggested trades for the nearest expiration date. Now, when buying in-the-money or deep ITM call options, it's usually best to select a contract that expires further into the future. This trade has less exposure to time decay and allows for more time for the trade to work out in your favor. Let’s look for trades that will expire in three months by adjusting the expiration to December 19, 2025. And there we have it, a 79-delta ITM trade. According to the screener, you can buy a 205-strike call on GOOGL for $33.45 per share or $3,345 total. The breakeven price is $238.45, just roughly $8 away from Google’s current trading price. The relatively close breakeven price is another advantage of ITM calls. By the way, delta also works as a shorthand indicator of the probability of profit. For long calls, this particular trade has a 79.3% chance of profiting. Best-case scenario, GOOGL trades above $238.45 with still ample time left in your contract. That way, you can sell the option for a tidy profit. Worst-case, Google falls below your $205 strike price, and you lose the premium paid. Bull Put Now, if you still want to participate in GOOGL’s potential upward momentum but don’t have $3,000 to fork out on an ITM long call, I recommend having a look at the bull put options strategy. A bull put is an intermediate-level options trading strategy that involves buying a put and selling another at a higher strike price on the same underlying asset with the same expiration date. The strategy aims to profit from the asset's anticipated moderately bullish price movement - emphasis on moderately, because there’s a point where you would have gotten a lot more money if you’d just bought an OTM long call instead. Setting up a bull put spread results in a net credit. Essentially, you’re getting paid upfront, and if Google goes up beyond your short strike, you get to keep the premium. Finding High-Potential Bull Put Trades Bull put trade suggestions can be found in the Verital Spreads page. For credit spreads, I like to give my trades time, but not too much. So, I’ll switch the expiration to October 3, 30 days from now. And here, we can find the suggested trades. Another trading preference of mine is limiting my loss probabilities to 30% or less when selling credit spreads, while still earning enough premium to make the trade worthwhile. So, I’ll pick the second one on the list here: According to this trade, you can sell a 225-strike short put on GOOGL and get $4.60 per share. At the same time, you can buy a 205-strike long put and pay $1.07, bringing your effective net credit to $3.53 or $353 total per contract (that’s just credit less debit for calculation, times 100 for the total amount). The trade has a 30.6% chance of ending at a loss. The great thing about bull put spreads is that they have defined risks. With this setup, as long as Google trades above $225 at expiration, your trade is profitable. However, if the stock falls below your $205 long strike, your losses are also limited to the difference between the strikes ($225 - $205 = $20), less your net credit ($20 - $3.53 = $16.47). Final Thoughts Long calls and a bull put spreads are both bullish strategies, but the difference lies in the execution and the results. For long calls, you’re anticipating that call options will be more expensive before your contract’s expiration, so you can sell them at a profit. For bull puts, the goal is for the stock to trade above your short strike. At the end of the day, your trading preference will help you decide which one fits better. Just be aware that, like with everything else in the market, there are risks involved. So, monitor your positions and always be ready to cut your losses, if required.

The move: After a difficult day for tech stocks yesterday, Google parent Alphabet soared as much as 9% on Wednesday, while Apple climbed nearly 4% at intraday highs. Alphabet is now up more than 20% in 2025, while Apple pared its year-to-date loss to 5%. Why: On September 2, a US judge rendered a verdict that Google would not be broken up, a decision that follows months of deliberation and speculation from investors. The judge also ruled that Google will not be forced to sell its Chrome web browser or Android operating system, an order that will stay in effect for the next six years. In August 2024, Mehta ruled that Google had engaged in illegal practices to maintain its digital search monopoly. This led to speculation that the dominance held by a few leading tech companies could be ending, as a forced Google breakup could lead to similar action against its peers such as Apple. Since Google appears to have avoided severe regulatory action, though, investors have less cause for concern. What it means: Considered the most significant antitrust case in decades, the landmark ruling carries major implications for both Google and the broader tech sector. Like Google, Apple has faced accusations of engaging in monopolistic practices, such as having an illegal hold over the smartphone market. The fact Google has avoided a forced breakup suggests that other companies are likely to do the same. This may be seen as a bullish indicator for tech stocks beyond just Alphabet and Apple, as many of the sector's other big names have faced similar antitrust accusations. ""In our view, the benign remedy ruling is a significant positive for GOOGL shares and should alleviate the overarching regulatory overhang,"" Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Deepak Mathivanan said in a recent report.

A federal judge ruled that the tech behemoth could keep Chrome and Android and its lucrative revenue-sharing deals, including Apple’s $20 billion annual pipeline. However, Google must also default to exclusivity while opening up parts of its search index, allowing access to its cutthroat competition. The stakes were massive: - A $317 billion Internet search market, according to IBIS. - $350 billion in Alphabet revenue last year. Regulators had been floating testing structural remedies over the past several months. 💵💰Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter💰💵 Needless to say, the implications if it had lost the case were enormous, with Apple’s search deal alone accounting for 4% to 6% of its profits. After hours, Alphabet (GOOGL) stock soared 7% as breakup risk finally came off the table. That said, a top Wall Street firm just issued a post-ruling note overhauling its price target on Google’s shares. It wasn’t just commentary but more about its positioning. And when they recalibrate, others typically follow. Google dodges breakup blow as Wedbush hikes target to $245 With Google coming out of the antitrust case mostly unscathed, Wedbush analysts issued a sharp note and raised Google’s price target. Wedbush analysts titled their note “Government Folds Like Cheap Suit,” while calling the result “broadly favorable for Google”. According to them, the court effectively rejected the most severe DOJ remedies. Related: Billionaire Ray Dalio's hard-hitting call on the economy turns heads Scott Devitt, who spearheads the internet equity research at Wedbush, highlighted three chief reasons the firm is staying bullish: - The decision takes the worst-case scenario off the table for Google. - The competitive impact of AI challengers, including the likes of OpenAI and Perplexity, is fading. - Google is “repositioning the business as a winner in the AI space”, with healthy demand and fast-growing cloud momentum. Consequently, Wedbush raised its price target on Google from $225 to $245. Moreover, Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush, added on X: “Huge win for Google in DOJ court ruling and Apple massive search deal survives. Big overhang removed from both Google and Apple.” More News: Also, for context, Scott Devitt is a 5-star rated analyst on TipRanks, with a 53% success rate and +12.7% average return per rating, adding solid credibility to his stance."

Alphabet (GOOGL) shares jumped Wednesday after a federal judge ruled Google doesn't have to sell its flagship Chrome browser, alleviating worries it could be forced to break up its business. The stock was up over 8% in recent trading near $229, leaving it on track to close at a record high after climbing as high as $230.86 shortly after the open. Heading into Wednesday's session, Alphabet shares had gained about 12% since the start of the year, though they trailed returns of top-performing Magnificent Seven stocks over the same period amid antitrust concerns and worries about AI-driven disruption. Below, we take a closer look at Alphabet’s weekly chart and apply technical analysis to point out price levels worth watching. Right-Angled Broadening Formation Breakout Alphabet shares have oscillated in a right-angled broadening formation since March, with the price recently rallying toward the pattern’s upper trendline. However, the stock broke out to an all-time high after Wednesday’s open, potentially setting the stage for a continuation of the longer-term uptrend. The relative strength index confirms strong price momentum, though a move into overbought territory would increase the chances for near-term profit taking. Let’s use prior price action to consider how a longer-term trend may play out on Alphabet’s chart and also identify two support levels worth monitoring during possible retracements in the stock. Uptrend Analysis Investors can forecast how the stock’s current move higher may evolve by using bars pattern analysis, a study that uses prior price bars to project future directional movements. When applying the technique to Alphabet’s chart, we extract the stock’s trending move higher from the March 2020 pandemic low to the November 2021 high and overlay it from this year’s April low. The analysis forecasts a target of around $395 and indicates the bullish period could last until December next year if price action rhymes with the prior move."

However, the reality is that many of these companies are still experiencing rapid growth and anticipate even greater gains on the horizon. By investing now, you can get in on the second wave of AI investing success before it hits. While it won't be nearly as lucrative as the first round that occurred from 2023 to 2024, it should still provide market-beating results, making these stocks great buys now. AI Hardware: Taiwan Semiconductor and Nvidia The demand for AI computing power appears to be insatiable. All of the AI hyperscalers are spending record amounts on building data centers in 2025, but they're also projecting to top that number in 2026. This bodes well for companies supplying products to fill those data centers with the computing power needed for processing AI workloads. Two of my favorites in this space are Nvidia (NVDA 0.86%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -1.59%). Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs), which have been the primary computing muscle for AI workloads so far. Thousands of GPUs are connected in clusters due to their ability to process multiple calculations in parallel, creating a powerful computing machine designed for training and processing AI workloads. Inside these GPUs are chips produced by Taiwan Semiconductor, the world's leading contract chip manufacturer. TSMC also supplies chips to Nvidia's competitors, such as Advanced Micro Devices, so it's playing both sides of the arms race. This is a great position to be in, and it has led to impressive growth for TSMC. Both Taiwan Semiconductor and Nvidia are capitalizing on massive data center demand, and have the growth to back it up. In Q2 FY 2026 (ending July 27), Nvidia's revenue increased by 56% year over year. Taiwan Semiconductor's revenue rose by 44% in its corresponding Q2, showcasing the strength of both of these businesses. With data center demand only expected to increase, both of these companies make for smart buys now. AI Hyperscalers: Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms The AI hyperscalers are companies that spend a significant amount of money on AI computing capacity for internal use and to provide tools for consumers. Three major players in this space are Amazon (AMZN -0.61%), Alphabet (GOOG 0.86%) (GOOGL 0.82%), and Meta Platforms (META 0.82%). Amazon makes this list due to the boost its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is experiencing. Cloud computing is benefiting from the AI arms race because it allows clients to rent computing power from companies that have more resources than they do. AWS is the market leader in this space, and it is a huge part of Amazon's business. Despite making up only 18% of Q2 revenue, it generated 53% of Amazon's operating profits. AWS is a significant beneficiary of AI and is helping drive the stock higher. Alphabet (GOOG 0.86%) (GOOGL 0.82%) also has a cloud computing wing with Google Cloud, but it's also developing one of the highest-performing generative AI models: Gemini. Alphabet has integrated Gemini into nearly all of its products, including its most important, Google Search. With the integration of generative AI into the traditional Google Search, Alphabet has bridged a gap that many investors feared would be the end for Google. This hasn't been the case, and Alphabet's impressive 12% growth in Google Search revenue in Q2 supports that. Despite its strong growth, Alphabet is by far the cheapest stock on this list, trading for less than 21 times forward earnings. With Alphabet's strength and strong position, combined with a cheap stock valuation, it's an excellent one to buy now. To round out this list, Meta Platforms (META 0.82%) is another smart pick. It's the parent company of social media platforms Facebook and Instagram, and gets a huge amount of money from ads. As a result, it's investing significant resources into improving how AI designs and targets ads, and it's already seeing some effects. AI has already increased the amount of time users spend on Facebook and Instagram, and is also driving more ad conversions. We're just scratching the surface of what AI can do for Meta's business, and with Meta spending a significant amount of money on top AI talent, it should be able to convert that into some substantial business wins. AI is a significant boost for the world's largest companies, and I wouldn't be surprised to see them outperform the broader market in the coming year as a result."

However, let's give Palantir the benefit of the doubt and say it can grow at a 40% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for the first five years of this decade-long analysis and 15% after that. By the end of the decade, Palantir would have revenue of $37.2 billion. That's over 10 times its current $3.4 billion it generated over the past 12 months. If Palantir could achieve a 35% profit margin, it would produce $13 billion in profits. That's an extremely bullish outlook for Palantir. The problem is that it doesn't allow it to outperform Alphabet. If we divide Palantir's current market cap of $377 billion by 2035's projected profits, we'd get a forward P/E of 28.9. Alphabet's stock is priced at less than that now and it would have a decade of growth to push its current stock price higher. The reality is, Palantir has at least five years, if not a decade, of growth already baked into the stock price.

It was an ad-tech company that soared more than 700%. That stock is AppLovin (APP) . The California-based adtech platform for mobile gaming apps went public in 2021 and rode the wave of online game excitement during the Covid era. Since then, it has built a position in the crowded digital ad market, competing with hyperscalers like Alphabet (GOOGL) and Meta (META) . Wall Street has rushed in, betting on the company’s AI-driven ad technology, which lets advertisers target users more effectively. The remarkable stock performance raised questions about the company's business and stock growth. Skeptics question AppLovin's AI hype In February, Culper Research revealed a short position in AppLovin, saying its surge last year was driven by investor enthusiasm for Axon 2.0, an ad-search engine. Short sale means betting a security's price will decline. ""AppLovin has used Axon 2.0 largely as a promotional tool — a smokescreen to hide the true drivers of its mobile gaming and e-commerce initiatives, neither of which have much to do with AI,"" the firm wrote. Related: Analysts revamp CrowdStrike stock target after earnings After the short reports, CEO Adam Foroughi defended the company’s technology in a blog, calling the reports ""littered with inaccuracies and false assertions."" ""A few nefarious short-sellers are making false and misleading claims aimed at undermining our success, and driving down our stock price for their own financial gain,"" he wrote. Despite the skepticism, AppLovin shares are up nearly 50% year to date.

The stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of less than 19 times analysts' 2026 earnings estimates, making it one of the cheapest megacap AI stocks out there. For a company with dominant positions in search, mobile, and video, along with rapidly growing cloud computing and robotaxi businesses, that valuation looks far too low. Search, AI, and Alphabet's distribution advantage One of the reasons why Alphabet's stock is so cheap is that investors have worries that AI will disrupt its Google Search business. So far, that hasn't happened. In fact, search revenue growth accelerated in the second quarter, climbing 12% year over year to $54.2 billion. Rather than people using Google less often, the addition of new AI features has actually helped drive more search queries. Currently, more than 2 billion people use AI Overviews inside Google Search, while its newly launched AI Mode is quickly gaining traction. AI Mode sits as an AI chatbot alongside Google search, so users can quickly toggle between an AI chatbot, search, news, images, etc., all in one place. In an Oppenheimer survey, 82% of users found it more useful than traditional search, and more than 60% said it was more helpful than OpenAI's ChatGPT. After a successful rollout in the U.S. and India, AI Mode is now being launched globally. One of Alphabet's advantages is that it doesn't need to change consumer habits. Billions of people already use Google every day, and by integrating AI into existing products, Alphabet is simply enhancing the user experience. That's a far easier task than trying to lure users away to a new platform. Alphabet's biggest advantage, though, is distribution. Chrome controls two-thirds of the global browser market, while Android powers over 70% of smartphones. Google is also the default search engine on Apple's Safari browser through a revenue-sharing deal. This makes Google the entry point to the internet for billions of people. It's also sometimes easy to forget that Alphabet has spent decades building one of the most powerful ad networks on the planet, which is capable of serving everything from powerful global brands to local stores down the block. With users and advertisers both in tow, this is a difficult moat for competitors to cross. Cloud computing and TPUs While search remains Alphabet's cash cow, Google Cloud has become a major growth driver. Revenue surged 32% in Q2 to $13.6 billion, while operating income more than doubled to $2.8 billion. The business has hit scale and is showing strong operating leverage. Customers are adopting Google's Gemini models, Vertex AI platform, and BigQuery analytics tools at a rapid pace. Developers are also turning to Google's custom tensor processing units (TPUs), which are optimized for AI workloads. These chips give Google Cloud a cost advantage, both by reducing its own infrastructure costs and by being able to offer a more efficient and cost-effective solution to its customers. TPUs are particularly important as AI inference grows, with most experts believing it will ultimately become a much bigger market than training. Right now, all cloud computing companies are seeing tremendous growth due to high demand, but if Google Cloud's TPUs can give it a cost-per-inference advantage, that would give it an edge when the market's growth eventually slows from its current breakneck pace. The company acknowledged that demand is running so hot that capacity constraints could last into 2026. That's actually a bullish signal. Alphabet is investing heavily in new data centers to meet demand, which should only expand Google Cloud's profitability over time. Emerging bets give Alphabet an advantage In addition to search and cloud computing, Alphabet also has a collection of emerging businesses with huge long-term potential. Waymo, its robotaxi unit, is leading the autonomous driving race in the U.S. The service is now available in multiple cities, and it's testing the service in 10 new markets, including New York and Philadelphia. The company is also making advancements in quantum computing. Its Willow chip has made progress on error reduction, which has been a major hurdle for the technology. While quantum computing is still years away from commercialization, it could become another massive growth driver for the company in the future. Alphabet is a dirt-cheap AI stock Alphabet has a strong collection of market-leading and emerging businesses. Yet despite this, it trades at one of the lowest valuations among big tech AI leaders. Investors still worry about disruption to search, but the data tells a different story. AI is currently leading to more search queries, not less, and the company has big network effect advantages due to its distribution and ad platform. Meanwhile, its cloud computing business is taking off, and Waymo has the potential to be a game-changer. For investors looking for a way to gain exposure to AI and other emerging technologies, Alphabet is one of the cheapest ways to do it."

There are some businesses that operate in this sector that have come to dominate while offering popular products and services. And shareholders have been able to receive huge returns. If you're ready to invest $5,000, here are two tech stocks to buy and hold for the long term. Massive user bases Investors should consider splitting $5,000 evenly between Alphabet (GOOGL 0.82%) (GOOG 0.86%) and Meta Platforms (META 0.82%). I believe these two dominant internet enterprises provide fantastic exposure to the technology sector. Both companies have gargantuan user bases. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in the second-quarter 2023 earnings press release that the business has ""fifteen products that each serve half a billion people, and six that serve over two billion each."" The company owns platforms like Google Search, YouTube, and Android, which billion of people use in their day-to-day lives. Meta is no slouch either. Its family of apps, which includes Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Threads, had 3.48 billion daily active users during Q2 (ended June 30). That figure was up 6% year over year, showcasing how incredibly popular these social media services are. What's obvious is that Alphabet and Meta are essential for people across the world. Besides that important point, they both have created powerful network effects. As the number of users and amount of usage grow, the products and services that Alphabet and Meta offer will only become better. That positive feedback loop is hard to beat. Strong financial positions Another clear reason I think investors should allocate $5,000 into these two stocks comes down to the fact that they are in pristine financial shape. This substantially reduces financial risk for anyone's portfolio, particularly when compared to companies that generate net losses or operate with weak balance sheets. In the latest quarter, Alphabet and Meta reported operating margins of 32% and 43%, respectively. Combined, they raked in $13.8 billion in free cash flow during Q2. And as of June 30, Alphabet had $95.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on the books, while Meta had $47.1 billion. Those liquidity figures are significantly higher than the companies' debt balances, allowing them to always operate from a position of strength. Thanks to their incredible profitability and robust balance sheets, Alphabet and Meta are in favorable positions to focus on pushing more time, effort, and resources into artificial intelligence (AI). Alphabet now plans to spend $85 billion on capital expenditures this year, with Meta upping its target to $69 billion (at the midpoint). This money will be used to build out technical infrastructure related to AI, as this new technology continues to shape corporate strategy and user experiences. Alphabet's Google Cloud offers clients various AI-powered tools to help developers work on AI apps. And within Google Search, the AI Overviews feature now has over 2 billion monthly active users. Meta's founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has undergone a massive AI talent spending spree. He believes that one day superintelligence will become a reality. Finding value in today's market environment As of Aug. 14, the S&P 500 Index trades in record territory. This bullish environment can discourage investors who are looking for attractively priced opportunities. However, these two stocks provide a glimmer of hope. At a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 20.4, Alphabet is the cheapest stock of any other ""Magnificent Seven"" constituent. Meta shares trade at a more expensive multiple of 28.1. Given that these two companies still have a long runway of double-digit annual earnings growth in the years ahead, investing $5,000 in total between them is a smart move."
8b0de816693ba06809204d1b851fd478aaae162cb5290540d6a4c71e65178239,GOOGL,Prediction : This Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) Stock Will Be Worth $5 Trillion in 5 Years,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/15/prediction-this-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-w/?source=iedfolrf0000001,www.fool.com,20250815T120000Z,semi,0.65,"Big-tech companies already hold nearly all of the spots in the top 10 largest companies in the world. Still, these companies are rapidly growing, so they're unlikely to relinquish their leadership roles. Over the next few years, investors shouldn't be surprised to see this cohort reach new heights, and one of the biggest success stories will likely be Alphabet (GOOG 0.86%) (GOOGL 0.82%). Alphabet is the parent company of Google, YouTube, Waymo, and the Android operating system, but the market isn't bullish on how the company generates most of its revenue. Despite this, I think Alphabet can grow into a $5 trillion company in five years and become a massive outperformer along the way. Most investors overestimate Google's challenges It's no secret that generative artificial intelligence (AI) is challenging the Google search engine. Some people have already replaced their search habits with a generative AI browser, but this is far from the majority. Still, that hasn't stopped people from stating that Google search will eventually go extinct. I think this is far too bold a prediction, as it assumes that an entire generation of users will suddenly change how they primarily use the internet. Most people don't need the search horsepower that a generative AI experience offers but are already getting a bit of Google's evolved process. At the top of each search, Google now displays an AI overview, which summarizes the search results using generative AI. This combination of traditional search and generative AI is likely to be enough for the vast majority of the population. Additionally, management has stated that generative AI overviews can be monetized at the same rate as traditional searches, which ensures Google's revenue stream will remain intact. Alphabet is also investing heavily in various parts of AI, such as an in-house generative AI model (Gemini), computing servers to host AI (Google Cloud), and self-driving vehicles (Waymo). All of this can help secure the company's position as a top artificial intelligence investment pick. However, can that help transform the company into a $5 trillion business by 2030? Alphabet's cheap valuation makes it a less risky pick Thanks to the market's bearish outlook on the Google search engine, the company's primary revenue driver, Alphabet currently has a very cheap valuation (at least compared to the broader market). At 20.3 times forward earnings, the company's stock is far cheaper than the broader market's 23.7 times forward earnings, as measured by the S&P 500. The long-term average return for the market is about 10% annually, so if Alphabet is growing its earnings at a 10% or greater pace, it should receive a premium valuation, compared to the market. Alphabet has steadily delivered 20% or greater earnings-per-share (EPS) growth over the past few years, so it has earned it. To bake some conservatism into this assessment, let's say that Alphabet's valuation could increase to 25 times forward earnings (which is still far cheaper than its big-tech peers), and can grow EPS by 15% over the next five years. If it did that, it would have EPS of $19.06 in five years. With a forward P/E of 25, that would price Alphabet's stock at more than $476 per share. At today's share count, that would value the company at around $5.75 trillion. That's a massive rise from today's $2.4 trillion market cap. If that happens, it will be a massive market outperformer. Alphabet is a strong candidate to outperform the market over the next few years and can easily reach a $5 trillion valuation over the next five years. It's one of my best stocks to buy now, and its cheap stock price plays a big role in that opinion."

While it's still early days, investors are betting big. In fact, enthusiasm around tech and AI has gotten so intense that the sector is now doing something not seen in over 25 years. In fact, the last time tech stocks climbed this high, it was right before a major market crash, which presents an ominous warning. Tech and AI are the market now Tech and AI make up a majority of the market, largely due to the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks. These megacap tech companies not only generate a tremendous amount of earnings and free cash flow, but they're pouring tens of billions into AI infrastructure and investments. As of Aug. 11, just eight tech companies account for 37% of the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.53%) Nvidia -- 7.8% Microsoft -- 6.9% Apple -- 5.9% Amazon -- 4.1% Meta Platforms -- 3.4% Broadcom -- 2.5% Alphabet Inc -- 2.2% Alphabet Inc -- 2.1% Tesla -- 1.9% All of these stocks have market caps of at least $1 trillion as of this writing. The largest of the bunch, Nvidia, is valued at $4.4 trillion. On the whole, tech and tech-related stocks make up the largest percentage of the stock market since 2000, according to a post from The Kobeissi Letter. Market concentration has never been this extreme: -- The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) August 4, 2025 Technology and tech-related stocks now make up a record 55% of the stock market. The share has DOUBLED since the 2008 Financial Crisis. To put this into perspective, this percentage hit ~50% at the 2000 Dot-Com Bubble peak.... pic.twitter.com/03bhKri9we This comparison to the dot-com bubble, one of the biggest market collapses in history, is worrying. At the time, venture capitalists were willing to fund entrepreneurs with business ideas but zero revenue or real products. In that environment, investors ran up internet stocks to massive valuations, and the S&P 500 surged about 20% or higher for five years straight. The market has followed an eerily similar path since the beginning of 2023. At the turn of the century, investors were overly bullish on the internet -- this time, it could be AI. Is there a difference between then and now? As I've pointed out on numerous occasions, history rhymes but rarely repeats itself, so the jury is still out on whether this current cycle will manifest into a bubble that pops the same way the dot-com bubble did. The conditions are there, including elevated valuations and an incredibly strong multiyear stock market run, fueled by low interest rates and, in this case, quantitative easing, which seems to have at least played a part in inflating assets. Investors who do not view this current cycle as a bubble will tell you that the companies funding the AI boom, like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Meta, are in superior financial condition to the companies that were driving the internet boom. Microsoft even has a better credit rating than the U.S. government. While I'm not an expert on the venture capital ecosystem, it also seems like these investors require more stringent criteria for funding, with many prioritizing those with working products and models generating revenue. However, it's also fair to argue that valuations have run amok. The internet boom proved that even technologies with immense potential rarely move in a straight line, and I expect the AI boom to be no different. The Magnificent 7 may experience sizable sell-offs before climbing another leg higher. While predicting short-term market moves is incredibly difficult, investors can still protect themselves by dollar-cost averaging, looking for stocks with valuations that make sense, and holding AI stocks for the long haul."

The tech titan has been trimming its position in CrowdStrike this year, having sold 353,665 of its shares in the first quarter. In Q2, it unloaded the remaining 74,230 CRWD shares as well. More News from Barchart - Supermicro’s Earnings Selloff Explained: Should You Buy SMCI Stock Now? - Amazon’s $36M Bet on Quantum Computing: What Investors Need to Know - AMD Stock Slips After Q2 Earnings, But Here’s Why It’s a Buying Opportunity CrowdStrike stock has pulled back rather significantly in recent weeks but is still up nearly 50% versus its year-to-date low in March. Why Alphabet’s Filing Isn’t Negative for CrowdStrike Stock Alphabet’s decision to pull out of CRWD stock isn’t necessarily bearish for the cybersecurity stock. According to Gene Frantz, general partner at Alphabet’s independent growth fund, CapitalG, via which the company held its stake in CrowdStrike, the fund retains conviction in cybersecurity firm’s leadership and its long-term potential. Frantz’ remarks suggest the divestment likely reflects portfolio rebalancing or liquidity needs rather than a loss of conviction. In fact, a blockbuster rally in CrowdStrike shares in the trailing 12 months confirms Alphabet’s exit marks the end of a successful investment cycle, not a judgement on future performance. Jim Cramer Says CRWD Shares Could Rally to $1,000 Note that CrowdStrike stock has soared nearly 400% over the past five years. Still, famed investor Jim Cramer recommends sticking with it as it’s not done pleasing its shareholders just yet. In a recent segment of Mad Money, the former hedge fund manager even signaled a possible surge in the cybersecurity stock to $1,000. “You have the best. Take out your cost basis, and let the rest run,” he told a caller in late July. Earlier this year, CrowdStrike acquired Flow Security, expanding capabilities in data observability and governance, which adds up to list of reasons to own CRWD shares in the second half of 2025. CrowdStrike Remains a Buy-Rated Stock Among Wall Street Analysts While not nearly as bullish as Cramer, Wall Street firms remain constructive on CrowdStrike stock as well. The consensus rating on CRWD shares currently sits at “Moderate Buy” with the mean target of roughly $484 indicating potential upside of more than 11% from here."

The market has gotten a bit overheated in some areas, and some growth stocks are just too expensive to justify buying right now. However, I've pinpointed one growth stock that also provides investors significant value, and it's well positioned to crush the market moving forward. The stock? Alphabet (GOOG 0.86%) (GOOGL 0.82%). Generative AI is challenging Google Search When it comes to big tech growth stocks, Alphabet usually isn't on top of the list, although it's typically included (think of FAANG or the ""Magnificent Seven""). The reason why it doesn't top the list is that it has more challenges to its growth story than the others do. The primary growth challenge is Alphabet's largest segment by revenue: Google Search. Many investors are worried that Google Search could lose out to generative artificial intelligence (AI) products, resulting in significant lost revenue for Alphabet. While there have been some defectors from Google Search to generative AI, investors need to be careful about using anecdotal evidence to estimate what will happen with the broader population. The reality is that the vast majority of Google users don't need a full-on generative AI experience. Instead, they have a simple question and want a simple answer, not a long, drawn-out explanation that some generative AI products give. Additionally, Google has taken steps to bridge the gap between a traditional search and a generative AI experience by integrating AI search overviews. This has become an incredibly popular product, and management has stated that the monetization of AI search overviews is similar to a typical Google Search, so investors don't need to worry about lost revenue with this feature. With over 2 billion users in 40 different languages, this evolution of Google Search is a key part of the Alphabet investment thesis. Even with some of the challenges Google is said to be facing, it's still delivering strong growth. Alphabet's stock is cheap for its growth rate In Q2, Google Search's revenue rose 12% year over year. That's an acceleration from Q1's 10% growth, so at least from a short-term financial-related standpoint, the bear case against Google Search appears to be incorrect. This could shift over the next five years, but considering Google's strong market position, I doubt this will happen. Alphabet also has other promising growth divisions, like its Waymo self-driving cars and Google Cloud. Google Cloud, in particular, is probably the most promising, as it's benefiting from the AI arms race. In Q2, Google Cloud's revenue rose 32% year over year, another acceleration from Q1's 28% growth. With its rapid growth rate and massive tailwinds, Google Cloud could become a much larger part of the Alphabet investment thesis over the next few years, making it a key area to watch. Overall, Alphabet posted a stellar Q2 with revenue rising 14% year over year and diluted earnings per share (EPS) rising 22%. Both of those far outperform the historical returns of the market (around 10%), clearly placing Alphabet in the growth stock category. However, there's one catch. Alphabet could also be considered a value stock. With the stock trading for under 20 times forward earnings, that's cheaper than the broader market, as measured by the S&P 500, which trades at 24 times forward earnings. With Alphabet being both cheaper than the market and growing faster than it, it makes for one of the smartest stocks to buy now. I think Alphabet has some of the best chances to outperform the market over the next five years, and buying the stock today gives investors a great shot at outperformance."

There are thousands to choose from, but not every stock is a solid buy right now. If you're going through the effort to pick individual stocks, then your one goal should be to outperform the market. Otherwise, you're better off just investing in an index fund (and there's nothing wrong with that). Two stocks that I think can crush the market moving forward are Alphabet (GOOG 0.86%) (GOOGL 0.82%) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM -1.59%). Both offer investors excellent value and make for great purchases at these levels. Alphabet Alphabet may be better known by some of the companies under its umbrella: Google, YouTube, Waymo, and the Android operating system. Alphabet has a wide reach, but most of its business boils down to advertising, particularly on the Google Search engine. Investors are worried that Google Search could be a victim of generative AI, as people may use alternative search engines or a full-on generative AI experience to gain information, just as they did on Google. Because Google wouldn't get that traffic anymore, it would see its ad revenue decline, dragging the stock down alongside it. However, the market has prematurely jumped to that conclusion. The stock is already cheap, trading at less than 20 times forward earnings, indicating that the market doesn't believe in Alphabet's future. Yet Alphabet's financials don't back up that theory. In the second quarter, Google Search's revenue rose 12% year over year. That doesn't sound like a dying business, especially when you consider that the first quarter's growth was 10%. Additionally, management sees huge momentum from its AI search overview product, which integrates generative AI with a traditional search result. This product is monetized at a similar rate to a traditional Google Search, so Google Search's revenue will continue to rise if AI search overviews remain a popular feature. Alphabet's stock is cheap, and the company is delivering excellent results. Revenue rose 14% and diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 22% in Q2. Few companies can provide the same growth and value that Alphabet does, making it an excellent buy now. Taiwan Semiconductor Taiwan Semiconductor is the world's leading contract chip manufacturer and provides manufacturing capabilities to companies that cannot do it themselves. Because there are relatively few semiconductor foundries worldwide, this makes nearly every advanced tech company a client of TSMC's. With such a broad and important customer base, management can see the general chip demand years in advance. At the start of 2025, they made the bold projection that AI-related revenue would increase at a 45% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years, with overall revenue rising at nearly a 20% CAGR. Few companies Taiwan Semiconductor's size (it's the ninth-largest company in the world at a $1.2 trillion market cap) are delivering that level of growth, which makes it an intriguing stock to scoop up now. While it's not as cheap as Alphabet, it's still reasonably priced at less than 25 times forward earnings. That's nearly the same price as the S&P 500, which trades for 24 times forward earnings. Taiwan Semiconductor is in an excellent position to continue growing over the next few years, and investors should feel confident scooping up shares now to capitalize on the booming chip market."

But this is not a case of hype with little substance; the top AI stocks are walking the walk, putting up impressive business results that show that the AI boom is not just real, but it's still going strong. These Fool.com contributors remain fascinated with Meta Platforms (META 0.82%), ASML (ASML 0.99%), and Alphabet (GOOGL 0.82%) (GOOG 0.86%), three winners that could continue to outperform for at least the rest of 2025. Here is what you need to know about each stock right now. Meta Platforms is an obvious buy after a standout Q2 performance Justin Pope (Meta Platforms): Just when I thought that Meta Platforms might be running out of steam, the company releases a blowout second-quarter earnings report that should have investors feeling giddy. It is becoming increasingly clear to investors how strong the core business is at Meta Platforms. The company's apps, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Threads, continue to add users. Meta's daily active users increased by 6% year over year to a whopping 3.48 billion in Q2 2025. At the same time, ad pricing grew by 9% year over year. As a result, Meta Platforms enjoyed 22% year-over-year revenue growth, and the company's net income surged by 36% versus the same quarter a year ago. This strength continues to show how vital artificial intelligence can be for Meta Platforms. On the one hand, it can utilize AI to automate aspects of its core advertising business and boost efficiency and profitability -- Meta's operating margin surged 5 percentage points from a year ago. On the other hand, AI represents a new frontier beyond smartphones, marked by Meta's expansion and investments in smart glasses. Meta recently traded at 27 times 2025 earnings estimates, and analysts expected it to grow by an average of over 16% annually over the next three to five years. However, Wall Street may need to quickly adjust its estimates to account for Meta's building momentum, which speaks volumes about what the company is capable of moving forward. Meta Platforms continues to raise the bar, which makes the stock a table-pounding buy as investors try to figure out just what its ceiling might be in this emerging golden age of AI. Temporary headwinds could be a buying opportunity in this chip manufacturer Will Healy (ASML): One AI stock that could finish strong in 2025 is ASML. It's not a household name, but it plays a critical role in AI. ASML leads the industry in extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV), the technology needed to make the world's most advanced chips. However, despite growing demand for AI-driven technology, it has experienced some significant headwinds. In recent months, companies like Intel have delayed or canceled foundry construction projects. ASML's market niche leaves it with only a small number of customers, so delays or lost customers will likely impact its financials significantly. Moreover, China-based Huawei has improved its EUV technology. That poses a possible competitive threat to an industry that ASML has dominated. However, Grand View Research expects the global AI market to reach a size of $1.8 trillion by 2030, amounting to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36% in that time! That will almost certainly increase the demand for AI chips, meaning the market will need more EUV machines from ASML. ASML's recent financial performance reflects that CAGR. It reported net sales of 15.4 billion euros ($17.8 billion) in the first half of 2025, a 34% yearly increase. The company also kept expense growth in check -- net income of over 4.6 billion euros ($5.4 billion) surged 66% higher over the same period. Still, analysts expect slowdowns to soon affect ASML's financials. Revenue projections for Q3 call for net sales between 7.4 billion and 7.9 billion euros, which would amount to just a 2% increase at the midpoint. Analysts projections confirm a slowdown is coming with 2025 revenue expected to slow to 14%. That deceleration has weighed on results, and the stock is down by nearly 20% over the last year. Nonetheless, investors may be overlooking ASML's 26 earnings multiple, an unusually low level since its five-year average P/E ratio is 42. As more investors notice the discounted valuation and take its long-term growth prospects into account, it could attract bargain hunters, setting the stock up for a comeback. Alphabet's cloud services business is on fire Jake Lerch (Alphabet): My choice is Alphabet. When Alphabet reported its second-quarter earnings results (for the three months ending on June 30, 2025) a couple of weeks ago, two items stood out to me. First off, the company reported year-over-year revenue growth of 14%, beating most analyst expectations. That's important because there has been a sense among analysts that the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution could really hurt Alphabet's golden goose: its Google Search business. The theory is that Google Search usage will drop off as more people turn to ChatGPT and other AI-powered chatbots for answers. In turn, Google's ad rates will drop, and Alphabet's revenue growth will suffer. It could happen -- but it isn't happening yet. In fact, ad revenue increased by about 10%. In other words, Google Search is doing just fine. Second, Alphabet reported that its cloud services business is red-hot. Google Cloud -- the third-largest cloud services provider behind Amazon and Microsoft -- reported revenue growth of 32%. Crucially, Alphabet's management chalked up the excellent performance to the AI boom. Ironically, one of the customers that has recently signed up to use Google Cloud is none other than OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. So, with its ad business performing decently and its cloud business performing nicely, all is well with Alphabet. And the company has other irons in the fire. Its Waymo subsidiary is one of the first companies bringing autonomous vehicles to the public, and its Quantum AI lab remains hard at work trying to revolutionize the very nature of computing. Alphabet's near-term and long-term prospects continue to look bright. Investors looking for an AI stock that could perform well in 2025 and beyond should consider it now."
